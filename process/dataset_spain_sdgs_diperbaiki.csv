Around those figures was then the port of Valencia, which now It is the second with the most tonnage, 70 million, and the port of Algeciras, which was barely relevant at that time with 116,000 tons, today is the national leader with 98 million tons, according to sources from the educational institution. The researchers from the Polytechnic of Cartagena selected the period 1962-1965 as being the most remote with homogeneous accounts, provided by the State Ports Library, and have also accessed, through the Documentation Service of the Port Authority of Cartagena, to data from the Port Works Board during the first five years of the 20th century.

"THE SIERRA DE LA FAUSILLA, EXAMPLE OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PORT AUTHORITY OF CARTAGENA","Between 2007 and 2008, the Port Authority developed the reforestation project around the Sierra de la Fausilla in Cartagena, one of the natural enclaves managed by this organization through its Environment Area. Environmental care and maintenance is a constant concern of the APC, which currently continues to work both in the Sierra de la Fausilla and in the rest of the natural environment within the Port's scope of work. For Antonio Sevilla, its President, “the care of natural spaces is a priority as part of our Corporate Social Responsibility policy.” The reforestation of the Sierra de la Fausilla is based on the study carried out in collaboration with the Polytechnic University of Cartagena (UPCT), which also advised the Port Authority in relation to the most suitable natural species that could occupy the space of this mountain range. In total, about 2,000 small-sized species and 900 medium-sized species were planted. Among the predominant species in the Sierra de la Fausilla, we find the Cartagena Cypress, an Ibero-African endemism present only in the coastal mountains of Cartagena and in Morocco, and the Aleppo Pine. These are species that survive on rainwater, but require special care in terms of phytosanitary treatments, pruning and tree cutting, a job carried out by the Port Authority of Cartagena, acting for the conservation of the environment, as in other natural environments in its field of activity, driven by its firm environmental commitment. http://www.apc.es/actualidad.php?reg=18¬=359",8,68

DAY ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE CARTAGENA REGION.,"The Regional Confederation of Business Organizations of Cartagena organized the 'Economic Development of the Region of Cartagena 2016' conference in the assembly hall of the Port Authority of Cartagena, where they talked about tourism, commerce, innovation and technology, the agri-food sector and industry, by different political and business authorities. The Conference was inaugurated by the president of COEC, Pedro Pablo Hernández; the president of the Port Authority of Cartagena, Antonio Sevilla; the president of the Cartagena Chamber of Commerce, Miguel Martínez; and the vice mayor of the Cartagena City Council, Ana Belén Castejón. Pedro Pablo Hernández has stated that the Cartagena Region “enjoys good health, although our pending issue continues to be infrastructure.” The president of COEC has stated that the services sector has improved significantly thanks to tourism, however the construction sector “is still not raising its head.” He also highlighted that the industry maintains “this positive evolution, just like agri-food, although its growth has slowed due to the lack of water, above all.” “The entire economic system of the Region is analyzed in these days. We not only make a diagnosis, but we also provide a series of recommendations that apply to everyone. For the business community, the study has meant an exercise in self-criticism and giving businessmen and the administration homework on important issues that we have to address,” said Pedro Pablo Hernández. Likewise, the president of the employers' association has emphasized the challenges that the Region has in terms of the economic system and they are innovation and internationalization. “The first thing we have to do, and it is common in all sectors, is to address the brakes that prevent the Cartagena Region from achieving the economic development it must have, such as the infrastructure of the AVE, El Gorguel, the Mediterranean Corridor, etc.” . For his part, Antonio Sevilla, president of the Port Authority, has highlighted that the study has to serve to make the business community aware of the situation. “There has been a lot of fighting for administrative simplification and from the business world we must continue, asking because that is what is going to help us companies progress.” He concluded by valuing this type of initiatives between the university and businessmen very positively. During the day, the study “Macroeconomic Perspectives of the Region of Cartagena” was presented, carried out by the COEC-UPCT Economic Situation Cabinet and which foresees a moderation of the economic growth of the Region for 2016 due to negative factors such as the foreseeable reform of the corporate tax, which aims to increase its collection, the possible increase in special taxes, the uncertainties generated by Brexit that can impact investment and damage strategic sectors for the Region such as tourism, construction and industry, and the consequences that the policies Trump's trade agreements may have on the region's foreign trade, according to the report presented by the Director of the Department of Economics of the Faculty of Business Sciences, Dr. Rosa Badillo. “The forecast for 2016 and 2017 is for positive growth, but lower than that of 2015, in all sectors. Maintaining the momentum of internal demand for private consumption will be the component of aggregate demand that will emerge as the fundamental engine of growth,” explains Badillo, director of the Cabinet that analyzes the macroeconomic data of the Cartagena Region on a quarterly basis. The study raises the main challenges for the economy of the Cartagena Region: reducing youth and long-term unemployment; diversify markets, targeting especially Asia and Africa; facilitate financing conditions; increase the business dimension to promote export propensity, improve transportation infrastructure; promote digital transformation in companies and direct efforts towards the most technological productive sectors. The Conference was closed by the president of COEC, Pedro Pablo Hernández; the president of the Port Authority of Cartagena, Antonio Sevilla; the General Director of Business Activity Simplification and Digital Economy, Francisco Abril; and the rector of the Polytechnic University of Cartagena, Alejandro Díaz.",8,61

Last year, cruise passengers accounted for almost 19% of the foreign tourism that arrived in the Region. There were 187,000 tourists on 120 cruise ships, the majority of whom were British (50%) and North Americans (25%), followed by Germans, Italians and French, which represents a year-on-year growth of 20% continued in the last three years that has consolidated us as the eighth port in Spain for cruises.

The Port of Cartagena exposes in Malaga its commitment to LNG for maritime transport,"Cartagena, May 14, 2018.— José María Gómez Fuster, head of the Exploitation Area at the Port Authority of Cartagena, attended the “Smart Ports” forum today, May 14. Strategic Management in Andalusian ports” organized by the Port of Malaga and the Junta de Andalucía and with the collaboration of Gas Natural. The objective of the forum is to discuss new ideas and present scientific advances that manage to develop port activity in a more efficient and sustainable way. The participation of the Port Authority of Cartagena in the round table that analyzes “the Smart approach according to the type of port”, and specifically on the supply of Liquefied Natural Gas to ships from the Port itself. An innovative initiative that the Port of Cartagena, Repsol and Enagás carried out for the first time in Europe in April 2017. Liquefied Natural Gas is one of the most ecological alternative fuels in the industry since it does not generate sulfur or particle emissions, and substantially reduces CO2 and Nitrogen Oxide, the famous NOx. For this reason, its use as in maritime transport is being promoted in recent years and more and more actors are betting on it. What differentiates this fuel from traditional Natural Gas? Basically, it is the same “gas” subjected to an extreme cooling process, up to -1600 degrees Celsius, so that it turns into a liquid state. This process is known as liquefaction and it reduces the most harmful compounds for the environment. This is possible because, in the process of cooling the gas, compounds such as sulfur, particles or part of the CO2 disappear. Therefore, we have a much cleaner liquid product that is also easier to transport. While traditional natural gas requires large infrastructure such as gas pipelines, liquefied natural gas can be transported in tanker trucks to areas where fuel is not so easily available. The Port Authority of Cartagena wants to promote an integrated logistics chain that allows LNG to be supplied from the port infrastructures themselves. In this way, what is known as the 'energy mix' is sought; That is, energy consumption that relies on clean fuels and allows us to reduce dependence on traditional hydrocarbons. “Cartagena was the first port in Europe to supply LNG to a ship,” declares Gómez Fuster, “sharing this type of progress with colleagues from other Port Authorities and actors in the sector allows us to continue improving in terms of sustainability.” And Cartagena is the first port that has a regulation for the supply of LNG for ships from a tanker truck. As a reference port in this process, it has innovative facilities prepared to carry out the activity in a safe and efficient way. “Our priority,” concludes Gómez Fuster, “is to increasingly promote the use of this fuel because it is not only more economical but much more respectful of the environment and our surroundings.”",9,102

"6,000 CRUISE SHIPS DORCH IN TWO DAYS AT THE PORT OF CARTAGENA","Cartagena, April 13, 2018.— A total of more than six thousand passengers will visit our city in two days, April 13 and 14, with two “maxi cruises”, the Konigsdam and the Crown Princess. The latter will be the first time it arrives at our port and its 3,100 passengers will be able to check out all the leisure and visit options that Cartagena offers them. The Konigsdam, bound for Rome, docked this morning after a 26-night journey through different ports in Europe. This ship from Holland America Line is characterized by offering extensive trips in different regions of the world. It will not be the first time that he visits our port, since he made a stopover this past Monday and will return on May 5. This shows how Cartagena is becoming more and more established in cruise tourism, since the ships usually return after a first experience. The Crown Princess, from Princess Cruises, will make a stopover in Cartagena for the first time. This company with origins in the United States offers long transatlantic trips. Its arrival, scheduled for eight in the morning, and leaving at two in the afternoon will allow its passengers to enjoy the good weather, the activities available in the city and the shops on our streets. April is going to be one of the largest months in terms of cruise ship arrivals, with 25 ships. For some it will be the first time they visit our coast and others will repeat the experience. Its passengers not only have the city's own offerings but also many other activities such as diving or nautical activities. For the president of the Port Authority, Joaquín Segado, this has a positive impact in many aspects, “the arrival of cruise passengers to the Port of Cartagena not only benefits our organization, but also expands trade opportunities in the city. This task is main for our work since it is essential that citizens benefit from opportunities such as the increase in indirect employment."" The presence at international fairs and the work of the Port Authority of Cartagena are allowing the number of cruise ships that pass through our port to grow more every year. Maintaining these statistics and continuing to improve their reception is part of our main objectives in order to continue actively contributing to both Cartagena and the Region of Murcia.",11,96
Joaquín Segado highlights that “the two blue flags in the Port give an idea of the quality that Cartagena's waters currently have”,"Cartagena, May 13, 2018.— Two blue flags will fly in the Port of Cartagena this summer. And the Real Club de Regatas de Cartagena has achieved the Blue Flag for marinas awarded by the Foundation for Environmental Education every year. This flag joins the one that has already flown in Cala Cortina uninterruptedly since 2007, one of the few Blue Flag beaches on the Cartagena coast. In this way, and until the month of September, these two recognitions will show the good quality and good work carried out by the institutions of the Port of Cartagena. The Port Authority of Cartagena has always wanted to contribute to ensuring that Cala Cortina, one of the busiest beaches in the municipality, has the environmental status necessary to obtain this recognition. To do this, Joaquín Segado highlights, “different actions are carried out to ensure the good quality of its waters.” One of these actions is, for example, the work of the “Pelican”, a special boat that removes waste, most of it plastic, from the surface of the water. Periodic water and sediment quality characterization campaigns are also carried out, within the framework of the Water Quality Control and Surveillance Plan in the Port area; and, in the summer, a floating barrier is installed to prevent possible marine pollution from affecting the beach, a circumstance that has not occurred to date. On the other hand, the awarding of a blue flag to the Regatta Club makes it the first marina in the municipality to achieve this environmental award. Something that, for the Port of Cartagena, is quite an honor since, as its president José García-Bravo declares, the Port Authority of Cartagena has been a key collaborator throughout the process. For Joaquín Segado, obtaining these two flags is “a reason for joy and pride since they give the notion of the quality that our waters currently have and it is thanks to the work carried out by the companies that make up the port community.” These awards, and the work that goes into achieving them, “also allow the people of Cartagena to enjoy beaches and recreational facilities with the greatest guarantees for both leisure and the environment.”",6,50
Fernando Muñoz explains in Melilla why Cartagena is a benchmark in cruise tourism.,"Cartagena, May 10, 2018.— Fernando Muñoz, head of the Business Development department of the Port Authority of Cartagena, has participated in the Melilla Cruise Forum, held this week at the Tryp Melilla Puerto Hotel and promoted by the Port Authority of Melilla with collaboration of the Government of the Autonomous City and the Maritime Station. This forum aims to promote Melilla in the sector and provide knowledge about the cruise industry to local companies and professionals involved in this type of tourism. The event, organized by Cruises News Media Group, an expert consulting company in the cruise industry, was aimed at all professionals in the port sector and auxiliary industries as well as companies in charge of services for cruise passengers. In short, all those who can benefit from the arrival of passengers to their cities. Throughout the day, various informative talks related to the cruise industry took place. Fernando Muñoz, representative of the Port of Cartagena, explained the transformation of the city and the port in recent years. A true success story that consisted of the adaptation of a mainly industrial and military city until it became a benchmark in tourism and services. A work that began in the 80s when Puertos del Estado proposed to integrate the port and the city. This was achieved thanks to the transfer of goods to the outer docks, Santa Lucía, San Pedro and Escombreras, and the construction and rehabilitation of infrastructures such as the Cruise Terminal, the Sea Wall or the Regatta Club. These actions, which began in the 90s, allowed Cartagenans and tourists to enjoy the historical and cultural offerings of the port city. They also marked the roadmap for future actions that will focus on the creation and improvement of service infrastructures that directly and indirectly benefit Cartagena and the Region. Currently, investments continue to be made in improving infrastructure for the city, with various works such as the expansion of the Cruise Terminal that allows simultaneous stops for two 300-meter-long cruise ships. This project, completed in May 2017, involved an investment of more than four million euros. This made it possible for 151 cruise ships to dock in Cartagena last year, disembarking more than two hundred and thirty thousand passengers in the city. This forum and various similar events serve to promote the city of Cartagena and its port services within the sector, in addition to observing and learning from other actions. Fernando Muñoz himself highlighted that the host city “is a destination yet to be discovered, with many cultural and urban similarities with Cartagena.” Our port, the eighth in Spain in terms of cruises, is increasingly a reference in good cruise practices ""not only in our country but internationally.""",9,96

The Port of Cartagena travels to Shanghai,"Cartagena, May 17, 2018.— From May 16 to 18, the “Transport Logistic China” will take place in Shanghai, China, a fair that will bring together more than 25,000 visitors from companies and organizations in the field of transportation. On those days, with 602 speakers, multiple activities will be held at the “Shanghai New International Expo Center” on logistics, mobility, IT and supply chain management. The Port Authority of Cartagena, represented by our Commercial Director Fernando Muñoz, attends this event with other representatives of State Ports. This event is mainly about the challenges and opportunities that digitalization presents us in the transportation sector and its transversal branches. For the maritime sector, new trends, such as the “Internet of Things”, make it possible to significantly increase navigation efficiency. Together with representatives from ports in Hamburg and Saudi Arabia, these experiences will be discussed during the “Smart Talks about Smart Ports” forum, part of the fair. China is leading the digitalization process in large areas of the transportation sector and, therefore, collaboration with China is key to the development of the Port of Cartagena. “The current relations with the country and its Port Authorities are being very satisfied, with examples such as the invitation to events of this caliber” declares Fernando Muñoz. Not only at a technological level, but also in economic relations, Cartagena is increasingly closer to the Asian coasts. Since, traffic with Asia represents almost eight million tons, something that places Cartagena as the fourth most important port in all of Spain. Within the Asian market, China is currently the sixth most important market. In total, in 2017 figures, a total of 187,321.94 tons were exported and 188,828.91 were imported. These figures have placed Cartagena on the map of the Chinese port market and its ports are increasingly interested in establishing working relationships with our city. International fairs of this size also allow us to know what is being done in other parts of the world, and not just in the host country. “It's not just the fact that they know you,” adds Fernando Muñoz, “but it allows you to understand how the market is evolving. In the end, our work is quite global, and although each port has its own particularities, we all want to move in the same direction.”",10,92

"THE PORT OF CARTAGENA MOBILIZES TRAFFIC OF 96,127 CONTAINERS AND MORE THAN 187,000 CRUISE PASSENGERS IN 2016","This morning the Board of Directors of the Port Authority of Cartagena met in an ordinary session, which was attended by the Minister of Development and Infrastructure of the Region of Murcia, Pedro Rivera. The president of the APC has reported on the volume of traffic that the Port of Cartagena moved during the past year, which continues to break records in terms of general merchandise and container traffic. Specifically, the Port of Cartagena moved traffic of 96,127 TEUs in 2016, which represents an increase of 4.72% compared to the previous year. This marks a growing trend that began in 2015, a year in which container transport grew by 3.4%. As is the case with general merchandise, which grew by 8.69%, reaching 1.39 million tons. In terms of cruises, Cartagena is already in the leading group of the ten main cruise ports in Spain, occupying eighth place. In 2016 there were 121 cruise calls, which represents an increase of 12.04%, and 1,988 ships, 1.69% more. Thus, 187,193 passengers have arrived at the Port of Cartagena, 24.54% more than in 2015. This significant increase is due to the fact that Cartagena became an embarkation port for the first time, a fact that will be repeated this year. Furthermore, the Port of Cartagena has transported 31.72 tons of merchandise in absolute terms, which has meant a slight decrease of 2.27% in relative terms and compared to 2015, already foreseen in the 2016 Business Plan, where estimated a closure of 31.81 million tons (with a deviation of less than 0.3%). This is the third best data in terms of traffic volume in the history of the Port, only surpassed in 2015 and 2014. The decrease has been basically due to the lower volume of liquid bulk, with 25 million tons being moved. through the port, 2.41% less than the previous year, but Cartagena is the second port in terms of liquid bulk traffic only behind Algeciras. The main causes of the decrease in liquid bulk are the scheduled shutdown of the Repsol refinery as well as the decrease in natural gas traffic through the port of Cartagena. This decrease in LNG is due to the increase in gas entry through the MEDGAZ gas pipeline and a regulation of tolls that have not favored the use of the Cartagena facilities as an LNG logistics terminal. For its part, solid bulk traffic stood at 5.32 million tons, with a decrease of 4.14% compared to 2015, due to lower traffic of cereals and iron ore; The latter was punctual in 2015 and practically disappeared in 2016. Special mention deserves livestock trafficking, which with more than 610,241 head shipped and 4.93% above the previous year, places the Port of Cartagena as a reference in the export of live animals. The main destination countries are Libya, Lebanon, Egypt and Algeria; By cabins, the calves, sheep and lambs selected at origin stand out, which are acquired by the client after a meticulous process, since the livestock must comply with Islamic standards that make them suitable for consumption. If we look at the statistics by tons exported, the increase has been 24.94%. The total turnover in 2016, compared to the data from the previous 2015, has decreased by 1.38% in relative terms, placing it in absolute at €41.86 million.

The congress aims to make known, through a set of conferences and presentations, the heritage process of the city and the port. The Assembly Hall of the UCAM Cartagena Campus and ARQUA will be the settings that will host communications from different personalities related to the city's heritage. Antonio Sevilla has shown in his speech how over the centuries the city has been gaining ground from the sea, but it was not until the 90s of the last century when port and city were united. Thus, in 1990, the Port-City Integration Plan of the Port of Cartagena began. The objective of this plan is the transformation of the port lands of the Alfonso XII Dock into an urban area, thus opening the city to the sea. To this end, the port tasks of loading, unloading and storage that were previously carried out in this area were previously transferred to the Santa Lucía and San Pedro docks, thus freeing up the land and the sheet of water on which the operations were carried out. different actions that were included within this plan: Construction of a Marina: 5 pontoons with space for 400 boats up to 12 meters in length (1994). Reorganization of traffic and creation of a boulevard along the entire pier and on the Cuesta del Batel: roads, sidewalks and gardens (1997). Rehabilitation and enhancement of the Wall of Charles III (or Sea Wall), BIC from the 18th century, on its maritime façade (2000). Construction of the new headquarters building for the Real Club de Regatas de Cartagena (2000). Construction of the Cruise Terminal (2001). Later expanded on several occasions. Construction of an underground parking lot with capacity for 650 vehicles (2001). Other actions that do not fall within this plan but follow these same objectives: Construction of a marina for yachts from 12 meters in length (2005). Reconstruction of the Old Regatta Club (2006). Urbanization of the surroundings of the La Curra Lighthouse (lighthouse, esplanade, gym equipment, area for fishermen) (2013). Improving road safety in Santa Lucía: sidewalks and on the Cala Cortina road. Adaptation of the urban environment of Santa Lucia. Actions by other administrations in this area, on land ceded by the port: ARQVA National Museum of Underwater Archeology and the El Batel Auditorium and Congress Center.

The esplanades and squares of this area host all types of events organized by both the City Council and other groups, including recitals, concerts, fairs, exhibitions, youth days, events sports, etc., which, together with the hospitality businesses that line the entire pier and the magnificent location of the promenade and the seaside squares, have turned the Alfonso XII Pier into a reference place for citizens and visitors. "" And as such, it must adapt to the needs of its users, and that is why it is currently undergoing renovation: on the one hand, it has improved vehicle access to the Cruise Terminal, eliminating the curves that make it difficult. arrival of buses transporting passengers. The commercial gallery of the Marina has also been eliminated, thus gaining a necessary esplanade for the multiple events that need space to be held in this environment. The congress is held with the collaboration of the Cartagena City Council and Cartagena Puerto de Culturas, the Vice-Rectorate of Research of the UCAM Cartagena, the Séneca Foundation, and the CIMAR Research Group - Catalan Institute of Cultural Heritage Research, a group that develops research, studies and proposals for parallel action in different geographical ports, organize this congress on October 5 and 6 where presentations will be given by local experts on the subject such as Carmen Berrocal, general coordinator of Historical and Archaeological Heritage.",11,96

Last year was the best in the history of Cartagena with 151 stops and more than 236,000 passengers who came to our city. For 2018, the forecasts continue to rise, consolidating Cartagena in eighth place in Spain in terms of cruises. Spain has achieved, thanks to the Government's determined commitment, in parallel to the work of other Administrations and its own private initiative, a privileged position in the global context in this sector, surpassing for the first time in its history the 9.2 million visitors on cruise ships. In addition to being the second European power in number of cruise passengers, several Spanish ports lead the European rankings and are even among the first 50 ports in the world, as is the case of the ports of Barcelona, those of the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands, Málaga, Valencia, Cádiz, Cartagena or Vigo. According to the forecasts of the Port Authorities, cruise traffic will continue to grow in Spain in the coming years at a rate of between 1.5 and 3%, probably exceeding 9.5 million cruise ships in 2020. With a view to that future Nearby, the Port Authority of Cartagena has held meetings with different cruise shipping companies to promote our city and expand those figures. As new developments, we can highlight the Pullmantur stops in 2018 and Disney in 2019.

This industry is a source of work in various sectors: technology, security, surveillance, hygiene, technical equipment, gastronomy, food, specialized marine personnel, tourist agencies, transportation, etc. This represents economic growth for cities that have a relevant cruise port, as in the case of Cartagena. The cruise has not only changed the tourism concept, offering comfort, safety and attractions, but it increasingly promotes shore excursions to archaeological, cultural and artistic sites, thus supporting the national heritage. Passengers enjoy the ship and also enjoy the cities. Cartagena continues in the wake of its port, growing as a tourist city and offering its heritage and services to all visitors who pass through it.",8,94
THE PORT OF CARTAGENA ADDRESSES THE USES OF LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS.,"Representatives of maritime, rail and road transport have participated in the conference organized by the Port of Cartagena, Enagás and GASNAM to promote the use of natural gas as an alternative to other types of fuels in transport. This Conference aims to be a meeting between LNG producers and marketers, logistics operators and marine, rail and road transport operators where each of them has presented their vision to facilitate the use of this fuel in their business activity. The day is divided into four sections dedicated, the first, to the impact of gas on the economy and the environment, as well as its use as transportation; the second as fuel in maritime transport; the third in land transport (by road and rail); and, the fourth will end with the intervention of the general director of Energy and Industrial and Mining Activity of the Regional Government, who will address the evolution and future of natural gas in the Region. This aims to contribute to the development of the use of natural gas in transportation as a realistic alternative to other fuels, with less environmental impact and more economical. Among the priorities of the Port of Cartagena is to increase freight traffic, LNG being one of those that presents the most immediate possibilities for development and which also respects the port's priorities: quality, safety and care for the environment. Antonio Sevilla has indicated ""that is why new logistics services have been developed, and continue to be improved, to meet market requirements and position Cartagena as an LNG logistics hub."" For his part, the General Director of Infrastructure of Enagás, Cludio Rodríguez, has highlighted the company's more than 45 years of experience in the sector. “With eight regasification plants, such as the one in Cartagena, the Iberian Peninsula has a privileged geostrategic position and has developed extensive knowhow in the development of logistics solutions, which are key to the promotion of LNG as an alternative fuel in transportation,” has pointed out. The APC has been the first in Spain to have an approved regulation for the supply of LNG to ships from tanker trucks. In addition, the Port Authority of Cartagena participates in a project to develop a supply chain for refueling at sea, of liquefied natural gas (LNG), in the Spanish Mediterranean basin, a project that has obtained European financing through the funds for the development of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-t Funds). In this sense, the President has indicated that ""it is currently the reference port for LNG bunkering in the Mediterranean, and we want to consolidate this position, promoting the use of a more efficient fuel such as LNG."" The port's port facilities, with two independent berths, and industrial facilities allow it to offer top quality services, both for LNG supply and loading and unloading operations, as well as new LNG operations such as small-scale and transit. (which could turn Cartagena into an LNG HUB). To date, supply operations have been carried out to the Kvitbjorn ship, the largest general cargo ship that has refueled this type of fuel, and to several tugboats. The commitment to the new opportunities of LNG (it is the title of the day) is a joint commitment by Enagás and the APC, and proof of this is the joint actions for the promotion of LNG reflected in the agreement that was signed in December 2014 and joint participation in the LNG HIVE project, co-financed with CEF funds. Manuel Lage, President of GASNAM, has highlighted the important role that Cartagena plays for this type of fuel, since it has a privileged position and the appropriate infrastructure for supply, unloading and distribution. The APC's commitment continues to be working together with producers and operators to promote this type of fuel. In addition, it must be taken into account that by 2020 ships have to use a less polluting fuel than fuel oil. It is a requirement by the International Maritime Organization and the European Union. One of the alternatives is Liquefied Natural Gas. For this reason, Cartagena wants to play a relevant role in the global expansion of the LNG market as an alternative fuel for ships, but also for road and rail transport.",14,78

CARTAGENA SELLS ITS EXPERIENCE IN OPTIMIZATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF GREEN OPERATIONS IN AMERICA.,"The president and general director of the Port Authority of Cartagena attend the XXVI Latin American Ports Congress, which is taking place this week in Punta del Este (Uruguay). Antonio Sevilla has participated in the panel “The perspectives of bulk terminals” together with Pablo Pussetto (Argentina) and Nicholas Ingle (England) and in the talks on special bulk projects: Tessa Major (Antwerp), Ramón RullMagre (Barcelona) and Rodolfo Sabonge. In his presentation he explained how the environmental policies that have been initiated in the Port of Cartagena, involving all the companies installed in its docks, have contributed to the improvement of the port environment. He noted that: “environmental improvements have contributed to placing the Port of Cartagena as the fourth port in Spain in terms of freight traffic and to being the most profitable in the system.” In addition to publicizing the facilities through a promotional video and explaining the facilities, traffic, and integration projects with its closest environment, it has also announced the initiatives carried out to become the most sustainable port in the Mediterranean. and remain the most profitable. And this is in line with the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) as a differentiating element and with the conviction that they are an effective communication tool and the opportunity that they represent for the business and institutional sector. Sevilla indicated that “the geostrategic position of the Port of Cartagena, in a privileged location for transoceanic routes and allows us to be in one of the main reference axes of European and world maritime trade. The main world trade lines pass next to the Port of Cartagena. This and the efforts made in infrastructure have made us the first Spanish port in bulk traffic, moving almost 32 million tons last year, of which 95% are bulk."" The president has highlighted the initiatives that the institution is carrying out to minimize the effects of handling bulk, including an operational semi-ecological hopper, and another one in modification, which have allowed a proven reduction in emissions of 75%; as well as the combination of traffic reorganization measures and physical measures (6 meter high walls and irrigation cisterns) to reduce dust clouds. Another measure adopted in unloading or loading solid bulk operations is to place a 12 x 10 meter tarp, covering the area of action of the crane's bucket. In this way, it is achieved that even though the buckets are already watertight, any loss of merchandise falls onto the canvas and not into the sea. The actions adopted also focus on innovation in the use of new materials in infrastructure, such as the use of fiber-reinforced polymer bars for the reinforcement of concrete structures, which presents a series of advantages compared to the use of steel bars, becoming in a very promising alternative especially in the case of reinforced concrete structures in aggressive environments, such as coastal areas and marine environments. Today there is no shoulder with this type of fiberglass reinforced polymers. In his presentation, he also addressed the main growth objective of the Port of Cartagena, for the coming years, the implementation of the new El Gorguel Dock. Located a short distance from the Escombreras dock, it will allow, with a draft of between 25 and 30 meters, to accommodate the largest container ships and take advantage of the privileged location of Cartagena to promote a HUB that also allows entry and exit of the company's products.

The Port in DIATIC 18,"Cartagena, May 18, 2018.- The Port of Cartagena was present at the events held on May 17 and 18 on the occasion of Information and Communication Technologies Day. Various talks and presentations were held on the sector and a closing gala in which Juan Antonio Sánchez, head of the Information Systems department, was nominated for “telecommunications engineer of the year”, coming in second place in the vote in which the members participate. These sessions seek to disseminate information about the incorporation of ICT in the tourism sector of our region. With this, all the latest developments and current technologies that can best be integrated into the field are made known and, in this way, common work synergies are found. The Port Authority of Cartagena participates as one of the sponsors of the conference and in the various activities that will be carried out during both days. At the Tourism Qualification Center, various “workshops” will be held between local administrations, tourism schools, associations and companies. The closing of this edition will be at the “ICT Day 2018 Gala Dinner and Awards Ceremony”, which took place at the 7 Coronas Hotel, on Friday, May 18 at 9:00 p.m. There our colleague Juan Antonio Sánchez, along with other relevant workers in the Murcian IT sector, went in recognition of his work in integrating these technologies in the Port of Cartagena. The development of the tourism sector including new ICT is a high priority in port work. Cartagena is a reference port in terms of tourism and cruises, and work is done every day to improve its facilities and services. In this regard, information and communication technologies allow us to speed up work and obtain better results. For Juan Antonio Sánchez “being recognized in events of this type is not only a personal pride but a demonstration that good work is being done in the Port of Cartagena. Our objectives always go hand in hand with the incorporation of new technologies that allow us to grow and provide better service.”",8,80
THE PORT OF CARTAGENA BEGINS 2018 BY STRENGTHENING ITS COMMITMENT TO ERADICATING MARINE TRASH,"Cartagena, April 12, 2018.— Every year the seas and oceans of our planet receive more than 8 million tons of garbage. This means that every second that passes we throw about 200 kilos of all kinds of garbage into the sea, although, by far, the majority (between 60 and 80%) is plastic waste. This situation has become a real problem for humanity that affects one of its most sensitive ecosystems, the marine one. The United Nations itself includes it as one of the challenges to be solved through the SDGs (the Sustainable Development Goals), which have been assumed by the Port Authority of Cartagena within its commitment to sustainable development. Cartagena, and more specifically its port, is no stranger to this great problem. In fact, the Port Authority of Cartagena (APC) has had a Pelican-type vessel dedicated exclusively to collecting solid waste from the port's water surface for more than a decade. This is a pelican-type boat with front claws that open to collect the debris found. For Joaquín Segado, president of APC, “the port's work to combat this serious problem has always been very active, the daily work of this vessel ensured that in 2016 5,160 tons of garbage were collected in the Port of Cartagena. However, during 2017 this figure has increased significantly, with the volume collected being 7,800 tons of waste. A fact that, without a doubt, should make us all reflect to continue insisting on the need to not throw garbage into the sea. We believe that the obligation to improve our education and environmental awareness so that waste does not reach the sea is increasingly imperative.” Plastics are once again the most numerous waste in the Port of Cartagena, with more than 63.98% of the total collected, followed far behind by wood with 25.01%. The month with the most garbage collected in 2017 was May, with 1,120 tons in a single month, followed by December, with 1,100 tons. The Mediterranean, one of the most affected seas Our sea, the Mediterranean, is one of the most affected by the problem of marine litter. Only 15% of the dumped garbage reaches the beach, and 70% of the waste sinks, causing serious problems in marine ecosystems. We cannot forget that a plastic bottle can take up to 500 years to degrade, so we can imagine the very high impact of each one that is thrown into the sea. The main problem with marine litter is its high dispersion and persistence. These factors cause the plastics that reach the marine environment to generate bags of waste, capable of putting extensive areas of aquatic ecosystems at risk. Derived from this situation, the problem posed by microplastics is added. These small particles derive from the plastic that is consumed and used (as packaging, exfoliants and thickeners, among others) and can end up adhering to the internal tissues of animals and, in this way, enter the food chain. The impacts of this problem are both socioeconomic, environmental and public health. For this reason, from the Port of Cartagena, we continue fighting to achieve zero discharge into our seas and oceans through initiatives such as our pelican-type boat, and promoting society's awareness of this serious problem, with marine waste collection campaigns. . If you want to know the importance of caring for the marine environment, you will find more information in Goal 14: The world's oceans – their temperature, chemistry, currents and life – move systems that make the Earth habitable for humanity. http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/es/oceans/",14,105
THE PORT AUTHORITY OF CARTAGENA CONSOLIDATES ITS NATIONAL LEADERSHIP AS THE MOST PROFITABLE PORT IN SPAIN FOR THE SIXTH CONSECUTIVE YEAR.,"The Region of Murcia consolidates its leadership at the national level with the most profitable port in Spain for the sixth consecutive year. The Port of Cartagena registered the highest profitability index of all Spanish ports in 2016, with 7.13 percent, which is more than triple the country's average (2.05 percent, according to provisional data). The Minister of Development and Infrastructure, Pedro Rivera, highlighted the “good evolution of the regional port industry”, after the Board of Directors of the Port of Cartagena, in which the accounts for the 2016 financial year were approved, and pointed out that these “magnificent data ""They will attract new investments and the application of more competitive rates for the sector."" ""In the last two years, the regional government has made a firm commitment to the Port of Cartagena as a reference in cruises and merchandise traffic, which is reflected in the continued growth of this infrastructure, which places us as one of the most active from all over Spain,” Rivera highlighted. The counselor stated that the regional government “will continue to value the peripheral location of the Region to be the gateway for entry and exit of goods from Europe, through the Port of Cartagena, to strengthen a solid, sustainable, efficient and profitable model.” ""which will be fundamental in the growth of the Region."" Positive evolution The positive evolution of the Port of Cartagena in recent years has allowed it to achieve a net turnover of 41.99 million euros, which represents a profit of 18.27 million euros, thanks largely to merchandise traffic . According to Antonio Sevilla, “the Port has consolidated its operating line, and despite the slight decrease in freight traffic during 2016, due to the technical stoppage of the Repsol refinery and lower LNG consumption, the economic result has barely changed. ”. The Region maintains its position within the group of the top five ports in Spain with the highest freight traffic and which in 2016 moved a total of 31.88 million tons. This figure is the third best data in terms of traffic volume in the history of the Region. The operating result was 18.01 million euros, with operating income of 45.61 million compared to expenses of 27.60 million. Furthermore, the Port of Cartagena is one of the five ports that contributes the most to the Interport Compensation Fund, with 1.44 million euros annually, an instrument of territorial cohesion that contributes to balancing the economic balance of the ports. In the session held today, Admiral Aniceto Rosique Nieto joined as a member, representing the General Administration of the State and replacing Marcial Gamboa Pérez-Pardo. A 4-month extension has also been approved to complete the works on the water intake of the desalination plant and the tender for the project “Recrecado espaldón dam Suroeste de Escombreras”, for an amount of €1,996,389 (VAT included).",8,98
Joaquín Segado “the opening of the Roman Theater was a turning point in attracting cruise tourists.,"Cartagena, May 11, 2018.— This project, which was approved by the board of trustees of the Roman Theater Foundation of Cartagena, formed by the Autonomous Community, the Cartagena City Council and the Cajamurcia Foundation, in December 2016, has had as its objective the improving the quality of visits with the application of new technologies for the recreation of the past through augmented reality and virtual reality, developed with the company “Imageen”. Starting May 11, visitors will be able to travel to Carthago Nova and live a completely immersive experience thanks to virtual reality. The startup specialized in historical VR and the Roman Theater Museum of Cartagena have carried out a unique project to virtually recreate the original architectural complex from the 1st century BC. C., in collaboration with the Port Authority of Cartagena. This system of virtual visits to the Roman Theater Museum of Cartagena is based on the use of different virtual reality and 360-degree mobile devices. It is an immersive experience in which the visitor, when accessing the monument, can view the same building reconstructed as it was in Roman times through glasses. In addition to this immersion, there is an audio explanation in English or Spanish about the transition from the present to the past with details of the different architectural elements and the life of the theater. Imageen, leader in the cultural tourism sector based on the virtual recreation of the past, and the Roman Theater Museum of Cartagena, present the new virtual reality project that recreates, in great detail and virtually, this architectural complex dating back to the years 5 and 1 a. C. A project available from May 11 and that allows visitors to relive the era of splendor that the Roman Theater of Cartagena had, one of the most important in the world. The project has been assigned to the European Year of Cultural Heritage as an activity of technological innovation. Through VR glasses, available in the Museum facilities, guided tours of the Museum will be carried out for groups. At the end of the tour you will be able to enjoy the architectural recreations of yesteryear and live an immersive experience in ancient Carthago Nova. This is a unique project in Spain and is considered the first practical implementation of virtual reality used to visit an archaeological site. When viewing the 3D recreation of the monument in great detail, the user can do so in two different ways. One of them is through virtual reality glasses that the Museum makes available to users for a price of 10 euros included in the guided tours, which will take place on Saturdays and Sundays at 11:30 a.m. Also through their personal smartphones or tablets, by downloading the Imageen-Cartagena app, from the Apple Store or Google Play, for only 2.5 euros the user will be able to view the virtual recreation. The mobile application thus becomes the key tool to immerse the visitor in the era of Roman Cartagena thanks to visualizing this unique architectural complex from 22 centuries ago. It can mainly be observed from the virtual viewing points marked in the Museum, from which the monument can be seen in its current state combined with the virtual view of the monument. All of this recreated with a hyper-realistic quality thanks to Imageen's virtual reality expertise. Thus, the 'traveler to the past' can see what the cavea was originally like, a semicircular structure in which the spectators, the orchestra or stage, the scaena frons or stage facade, and the porticus post scaenam, a porticoed gallery that surrounds a space, were located. landscaped and which constitutes one of the distinctive elements of Roman theatrical architecture. The app also has a virtual guide who accompanies the traveler during the visit and explains, in Spanish or English, the transition from the past to the present, as well as the different architectural elements and the activity of the Theater in its time. In addition, visitors also have a video of about two minutes long about the place and an immersive virtual flight through the entire site. Imageen, together with the Museum's recommendations, has recorded an excerpt from a play of the time, a small mime, where the actors did not wear masks, which has been incorporated into the guided tour and can be observed from one of the points virtual viewing of the theater, although we will also see them act in a tragedy, where the actors used masks for both female and male roles. The Port Authority of Cartagena, which collaborates in this project, has been working for 20 years to develop cruise tourism in the city and promoting the Region of Murcia as a tourist destination so that cruise passengers can take excursions during their stopover in the port. In these years it has collaborated with the city, the region and businessmen to consolidate Cartagena as a tourist reference for the shipping industry. Joaquín Segado, president of the Port Authority of Cartagena: “the opening of the Roman Theater 10 years ago was a turning point in attracting cruise tourists. In 2008, the year of its inauguration, the Port received 35,000 cruise passengers, which doubled the following year, reaching 237,000 last year. But we must continue working on the consolidation of the Cartagena brand as a tourist destination, so collaboration between all the agents involved is essential."" Since the opening of the Roman Theater Museum in 2008, it has become the symbol that best represents the city of Cartagena. The Port Authority has seen this and has used it as the main claim for shipping companies to include the city in the itineraries of their ships, so it collaborates in this project due to the great interest that shipping companies have in being able to offer exclusive excursions. , innovative and that provide a more attractive experience for its passengers.",11,17
The Port Authority of Cartagena and the University of Murcia and the Polytechnic University of Cartagena show their commitment to the environment.,"The president of the Port Authority of Cartagena and the rectors of the University of Murcia and the Polytechnic of Cartagena have signed the contracts for research projects selected by the Permanent Commission of the Interuniversity Chair of the Environment, with the aim of promoting and carrying out studies and multidisciplinary investigations on environmental matters in the surroundings of the Port of Cartagena and that, in turn, can be used in the management of the Port Authority of Cartagena. The bases were published on the websites of the three institutions in March of this year and were aimed at researchers from both universities in the Region whose work can contribute to the development of knowledge in the port field and related to the Natura 2000 Network, biodiversity and responsible management. of species and habitat, underwater noise, marine pollution, and contaminated soils. 12 proposals were submitted to this call and four were selected. Underwater noise monitoring using Autonomous Underwater Vehicles. Integration of an intelligent hydrophone in an AUV IVER2_Ecomapper, whose directors are professors Javier Gilabert Cervera and José Luis Sancho Gómez from the UPCT, consists of the design and implementation of an underwater acoustic monitoring system with the characteristic of being mobile and autonomous , which represents an increase in possibilities for measuring all types of underwater noise. This system will allow the measurement of underwater noise, characterize and evaluate the variations; It will provide the data to make a precise noise map of larger areas; will allow cetaceans to be automatically detected based on their sounds; etc., 28,444.96 euros have been allocated to this project. The project Environmental diagnosis, risk analysis and definition of corrective measures in abandoned sludge deposits on Rambla del Avenque (Cartagena), has a budget of 28,385.18 euros and is directed by UPCT professor Ángel Faz Cano. It consists of the preparation of an environmental diagnosis of two flotation sludge deposits located on Rambla del Avenque, from a hydrological, geophysical and geochemical point of view. An environmental risk analysis will be carried out and corrective measures will be proposed to reduce the risks that are detected. It is focused on mining waste deposits, characteristic of the Sierra Minera, with high concentrations of heavy metals. For her part, Pilar de la Rúa Tarin, from the University of Murcia, will be responsible for directing the proposal for the Evaluation of pollination and seed dispersal networks as key factors for the conservation of habitat 5220* on the coast of Cartagena. It will be focused on the study of the two most important interaction networks between plant-animal: pollination and seed dispersal, as well as its key role in the conservation of the priority habitat of arborescent scrub in the Sierra de la Fausilla. Its purpose is to establish a diagnosis of the current state of conservation and future prospects of this habitat in one of the few representative areas of it in the Spanish southeast. It has a budget of 19,849.52 euros. The study focuses on two of the representative species of this habitat, Ziziphus lotus (jujube) and Maytenus senegalensis (hawthorn), both classified as vulnerable in the Region of Murcia. Analysis of the population structure and captive breeding of the long-snouted seahorse Hippocampus guttulatus, a proposal directed by José Galián Albaladejo from the University of Murcia, will have an amount of 19,828.8 euros for the design of conservation programs for the long-snouted seahorse. sea, common in the Mar Menor and that due to the gradual deterioration that the lagoon has suffered in recent decades has led to a significant decrease in its population in this habitat. Although it is a species distributed in areas of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, due to its limited mobility combined with its location in the Mar Menor, it suggests that the reproductive exchange of this species with open sea populations could be limited, so it is It is necessary to determine whether the population of seahorses in the lagoon has its own genetic peculiarities that justify greater protection since it is a peculiar and endemic population of the biotope. All these projects are part of the agreement signed in July of last year and launched by the Port Authority of Cartagena, aware that permanent work must be carried out on the Environment, recognizing and promoting environmental values, the habitats of their environment and the floristic and faunal elements that could inhabit them. Therefore, it was considered necessary to launch an Environment Chair with the Polytechnic University of Cartagena and the University of Murcia, through the “Mare Nostrum 37/38” Campus of International Excellence, aimed at channeling R&D+ actions.

THE PORT OF CARTAGENA SUPPORTS A RESEARCH PROJECT ON THE MOST COMMON SEAHORSE OF THE MAR MENOR,"The Port Authority of Cartagena (APC) is supporting an ambitious research project that aims to study the population structure and captive breeding of one of the most common marine animals in the Mar Menor, the long-snouted seahorse Hippocampus guttulatus. “Research on this type of seahorse, like the rest of the projects developed by the chair, is part of one of the fundamental lines of our corporate social responsibility policy; the care of our natural environment. We are surrounded by a body of water that has a habitat that must be conserved. The project “Analysis of the population structure and captive breeding of the long-snouted seahorse Hippocampus guttulatus” is directed by Professor José Galián Albadalejo. Its main objective is the design of conservation programs for this very common marine species in the Mar Menor and which, due to the gradual deterioration that the water surface has suffered in recent decades, has considerably reduced its presence in this very important ecosystem of our region. The research, which is currently underway, wants to determine if the population of horseies in the lagoon has its own genetic peculiarities that justify greater protection, since it is a peculiar species endemic to this natural biotope. As with other types of marine fauna, the main threats to the seahorse are the destruction of coastal habitats, the pollution of coastal lagoons and estuaries, and selective collection for decorative or aquarium purposes. This is just one example of the actions undertaken by the Port of Cartagena to endorse its clear commitment to the development of a port activity that is compatible with the conservation of biodiversity, in line with objective No. 14 of the Sustainable Development Goals set. by the United Nations. “We believe that we have a responsibility to the conservation and sustainable use of all marine resources. The sea is our natural habitat and we must take care of it, minimizing our impact as much as possible. Our strategy for 2030 is to become the most sustainable port in the Mediterranean and instruments such as the APC-Campus Mare Nostrum Chair help us successfully follow that path.” In addition to this research project, the Port Authority of Cartagena has also undertaken numerous projects to improve and conserve the environment, both terrestrial and maritime. “In our sphere of influence we have up to five protected natural spaces and our intention is to take care of them and improve them every day.”",14,120
THE PORT OF CARTAGENA CELEBRATES WORLD OCEANS DAY TODAY,"“Our oceans, our future”, this is the motto with which the UN celebrates World Oceans Day today, June 8. The Port of Cartagena joins this celebration that seeks to raise awareness about the great role they play in our lives since they are the true lungs of the earth, generating most of the oxygen we consume and absorbing about 25% of the carbon emissions that we consume. we generate. The oceans make up 70% of the Earth's surface but only 1% of its surface is protected. The United Nations highlights the need for sustainable management that allows them to be recovered since, among other things, they are a fundamental element in climate regulation. The preservation of the marine ecosystem is one of the main objectives of the sustainable management policy developed by the Port of Cartagena, one of the first in Spain to have an entity adhered to the EMAS registry and a finalist last year in the ESPO Award for the European port. more sustainable in terms of biodiversity. During 2016, the APC removed more than 5,160 tons of solid waste from the port's waters, 66% of which were plastic, and each month a rigorous sampling process is followed to evaluate the quality of the waters thanks to an agreement signed with the CARM. An excellent indicator of the good condition of the port's waters is that the presence of the “nacra” mollusk, Pinna nobilis, has been detected. This is a species that only appears in clean waters and this is confirmed by environmental authorities, who have described the ecological and chemical status of the port's waters as good. The Port of Cartagena also has within its scope the Cala Cortina beach which, once again, has revalidated the Blue Flag awarded by the European Union, demonstrating that economic development and environmental protection are perfectly compatible. Without a doubt, the deployment of the anti-pollution barrier in summer is a guarantee of protection for this natural area. The work of conservation and protection of the oceans concerns us all and from the Port of Cartagena we renew our commitment on World Day to contribute our grain of sand to this purpose that is included in the Millennium SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals). .",14,117

Likewise, the new communication channel and the website www.elcorredormediterraneo.com have been presented, where all the content related to the Mediterranean Corridor can be viewed. The president of AVE, Vicente Boluda, has been in charge of presenting the project that aims to link the south of Europe with the north with a 3,500 km railway network, intended to reduce transport times by almost half, as well as to improve train frequency and boost tourism. This project is aimed at promoting connections between the port of Cartagena and other ports in the Spanish Mediterranean, and its logistics and industrial areas. As of today, the direct connection of Cartagena and its Port, the fourth in the country in freight traffic, with the Mediterranean Corridor remains to be defined. It is planned that this connection will be made on a double platform of international width and without the need to pass through Murcia. The general director of the Port Authority, Fermín Rol, has stated that this connection will not only facilitate the mobility of travelers, which will result in an increase in tourism, but will also allow the mobility of goods that will result in more exports. “We are convinced that the data that supports the Port of Cartagena as the fourth Spanish port in terms of merchandise volume will improve with the rail corridor,” stated Fermín Rol. Likewise, he pointed out that the connection of ports with the land transportation network is a fundamental element for integration into the dynamics of growth and job creation. The Mediterranean Corridor is a double high-speed railway that will run from the French border to Algeciras, linking such important cities as Barcelona, Valencia, Alicante, Murcia and Malaga and connecting them in turn with the rest of Europe. The Mediterranean Corridor will reduce travel times between important cities such as Barcelona, Valencia, Alicante, Murcia, Almería, Málaga or Algeciras by almost half and even more in some sections. Domestic tourism, weekend trips and work trips will multiply along the entire route.",10,58
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEVELOPMENT PRAISES THE MANAGEMENT OF THE PORT OF CARTAGENA.,"The Secretary of State for Development has visited the railway access works to Escombreras, together with the President of State Ports, the President of the APC, Government Delegate and Councilor for Development and Infrastructure of the Autonomous Community.

"The Port of Cartagena already stood out in the 60s for its efficiency, according to a thesis","The Port of Cartagena stood out, in the period 1962-1965, in the midst of the economic opening of the Franco regime, for its efficiency and for being the one that moved the largest tons of cargo in all of Spain, according to the historical data analyzed by a doctoral thesis carried out in the within the Department of Financial Economics and Accounting of the Faculty of Business Sciences of the Polytechnic University of Cartagena (UPCT). The historical data have been provided by the Port Authority of Cartagena, through Francisco García Menchón, who has provided documentation and data to the researcher.

""The Port of Cartagena is the only one that in all the models analyzed stands out for its excellent levels of performance compared to the rest of the Spanish ports at that historical moment,"" summarizes the new doctor. ""During those years, a general improvement in productive change was observed, especially influenced by a significant technological advance in the Spanish port system,"" adds the director of the research, Isidoro Guzmán Raja. Currently, the Port of Cartagena is the most profitable of Spain, according to the latest annual accounts published. Regarding the period analyzed by the researchers, the tons transported have tripled since then, going from more than 11 million on average between 1962 and 1965 to 32.6 million in 2015. In 1962 Cartagena was the port that moved the most tons in Spain, practically quintupling the average of just over 2 million tons that were loaded and unloaded through all the ports. Around those figures was then the port of Valencia, which now It is the second with the most tonnage, 70 million, and the port of Algeciras, which was barely relevant at that time with 116,000 tons, today is the national leader with 98 million tons, according to sources from the educational institution. The researchers from the Polytechnic of Cartagena selected the period 1962-1965 as being the most remote with homogeneous accounts, provided by the State Ports Library, and have also accessed, through the Documentation Service of the Port Authority of Cartagena, to data from the Port Works Board during the first five years of the 20th century.

"THE SIERRA DE LA FAUSILLA, EXAMPLE OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PORT AUTHORITY OF CARTAGENA","Between 2007 and 2008, the Port Authority developed the reforestation project around the Sierra de la Fausilla in Cartagena, one of the natural enclaves managed by this organization through its Environment Area. Environmental care and maintenance is a constant concern of the APC, which currently continues to work both in the Sierra de la Fausilla and in the rest of the natural environment within the Port's scope of work. For Antonio Sevilla, its President, “the care of natural spaces is a priority as part of our Corporate Social Responsibility policy.” The reforestation of the Sierra de la Fausilla is based on the study carried out in collaboration with the Polytechnic University of Cartagena (UPCT), which also advised the Port Authority in relation to the most suitable natural species that could occupy the space of this mountain range. In total, about 2,000 small-sized species and 900 medium-sized species were planted. Among the predominant species in the Sierra de la Fausilla, we find the Cartagena Cypress, an Ibero-African endemism present only in the coastal mountains of Cartagena and in Morocco, and the Aleppo Pine. These are species that survive on rainwater, but require special care in terms of phytosanitary treatments, pruning and tree cutting, a job carried out by the Port Authority of Cartagena, acting for the conservation of the environment, as in other natural environments in its field of activity, driven by its firm environmental commitment. http://www.apc.es/actualidad.php?reg=18¬=359",8,68

DAY ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE CARTAGENA REGION.,"The Regional Confederation of Business Organizations of Cartagena organized the 'Economic Development of the Region of Cartagena 2016' conference in the assembly hall of the Port Authority of Cartagena, where they talked about tourism, commerce, innovation and technology, the agri-food sector and industry, by different political and business authorities. The Conference was inaugurated by the president of COEC, Pedro Pablo Hernández; the president of the Port Authority of Cartagena, Antonio Sevilla; the president of the Cartagena Chamber of Commerce, Miguel Martínez; and the vice mayor of the Cartagena City Council, Ana Belén Castejón. Pedro Pablo Hernández has stated that the Cartagena Region “enjoys good health, although our pending issue continues to be infrastructure.” The president of COEC has stated that the services sector has improved significantly thanks to tourism, however the construction sector “is still not raising its head.” He also highlighted that the industry maintains “this positive evolution, just like agri-food, although its growth has slowed due to the lack of water, above all.” “The entire economic system of the Region is analyzed in these days. We not only make a diagnosis, but we also provide a series of recommendations that apply to everyone. For the business community, the study has meant an exercise in self-criticism and giving businessmen and the administration homework on important issues that we have to address,” said Pedro Pablo Hernández. Likewise, the president of the employers' association has emphasized the challenges that the Region has in terms of the economic system and they are innovation and internationalization. “The first thing we have to do, and it is common in all sectors, is to address the brakes that prevent the Cartagena Region from achieving the economic development it must have, such as the infrastructure of the AVE, El Gorguel, the Mediterranean Corridor, etc.” . For his part, Antonio Sevilla, president of the Port Authority, has highlighted that the study has to serve to make the business community aware of the situation. “There has been a lot of fighting for administrative simplification and from the business world we must continue, asking because that is what is going to help us companies progress.” He concluded by valuing this type of initiatives between the university and businessmen very positively. During the day, the study “Macroeconomic Perspectives of the Region of Cartagena” was presented, carried out by the COEC-UPCT Economic Situation Cabinet and which foresees a moderation of the economic growth of the Region for 2016 due to negative factors such as the foreseeable reform of the corporate tax, which aims to increase its collection, the possible increase in special taxes, the uncertainties generated by Brexit that can impact investment and damage strategic sectors for the Region such as tourism, construction and industry, and the consequences that the policies Trump's trade agreements may have on the region's foreign trade, according to the report presented by the Director of the Department of Economics of the Faculty of Business Sciences, Dr. Rosa Badillo. “The forecast for 2016 and 2017 is for positive growth, but lower than that of 2015, in all sectors. Maintaining the momentum of internal demand for private consumption will be the component of aggregate demand that will emerge as the fundamental engine of growth,” explains Badillo, director of the Cabinet that analyzes the macroeconomic data of the Cartagena Region on a quarterly basis. The study raises the main challenges for the economy of the Cartagena Region: reducing youth and long-term unemployment; diversify markets, targeting especially Asia and Africa; facilitate financing conditions; increase the business dimension to promote export propensity, improve transportation infrastructure; promote digital transformation in companies and direct efforts towards the most technological productive sectors. The Conference was closed by the president of COEC, Pedro Pablo Hernández; the president of the Port Authority of Cartagena, Antonio Sevilla; the General Director of Business Activity Simplification and Digital Economy, Francisco Abril; and the rector of the Polytechnic University of Cartagena, Alejandro Díaz.",8,61

200 PROFESSIONALS FROM THE CRUISE SECTOR MEET AT CARTAGENA CRUISE FORUM,"The president of the Port Authority of Cartagena, Antonio Sevilla, together with the general director of the Tourism Institute, Manuel Fernández-Delgado, have inaugurated the 'Cartagena Cruise Forum 2017' in which the growth in the arrival of cruise passengers to the Region that has gone from 35,000 to 230,000 in the last nine years, with an interannual growth of 20% in the last two years. Seville has indicated that “the Port of Cartagena is a fundamental infrastructure for the Region of Murcia, for its citizens and its development with a great social and economic impact, and the actions it has implemented, including tourism promotion, have as objective of making a Region better prepared to face present and future challenges”, at the conference organized in Cartagena that brought together more than 200 professionals from the sector. The constant updating of the activity and the facilities to respond adequately to the continuous changes experienced by all markets, and with more incidence the cruise sector, as well as the promotion of projects and initiatives are necessary to adapt to the demands of cruise passengers, This has been highlighted by the speakers who, in the same way, have pointed out that the effort must be joint with the business, commercial and cultural fabric to make Cartagena an attractive destination for cruise tourism. Last year, cruise passengers accounted for almost 19% of the foreign tourism that arrived in the Region. There were 187,000 tourists on 120 cruise ships, the majority of whom were British (50%) and North Americans (25%), followed by Germans, Italians and French, which represents a year-on-year growth of 20% continued in the last three years that has consolidated us as the eighth port in Spain for cruises. This year's forecasts are for the arrival of 230,000 passengers on 150 ships, which will exceed the number of cruise passengers reached in 2016, which represents an interannual growth of 24.3%. To date, 143 cruise ships have arrived with 218,000 passengers. Consolidating this traffic is the objective of the Port Authority in the coming years, which is why it is essential to invest in infrastructure and facilities, in addition to developing important commercial work so that large shipping companies include Cartagena in their routes. “The latest expansion of the cruise terminal, with an investment of 4.9 million euros, has represented a great qualitative leap, since it allows the arrival of up to two ships of 330 meters in length simultaneously and the disembarkation of up to 7,000 people at the Alfonso Likewise, the director of the Tourism Institute encouraged the regional companies present at this event to create new excursion packages to extend the benefit that cruise passengers leave to other destinations in the Region beyond Cartagena. “Cartagena has consolidated a network of ground services capable of guaranteeing the satisfaction of cruise passengers, which provides very important income to small businesses, creating synergies with other sectors such as transportation or hospitality and restaurants, but it is possible to extend these benefits to the rest of the Region,” said the general director of the Tourism Institute. In this sense, the creation of excursions that are capable of providing differential value to the destination is presented as one of the most effective resources, since on the one hand they can seduce shipping companies to schedule the Port of Cartagena, further increasing more traffic in the winter months and, on the other, generate profits in an area that is not only limited to the port. The 'Cartagena Cruise Forum 2017' is aimed at professionals from the port sector, auxiliary industry, travel agencies, institutions related to tourism promotion, as well as hotel services, guides, restaurants, museums, taxis, businesses and, in general, all those services that can benefit from the arrival of cruise passengers to Cartagena.",16,69

The Port of Cartagena exposes in Malaga its commitment to LNG for maritime transport,"Cartagena, May 14, 2018.— José María Gómez Fuster, head of the Exploitation Area at the Port Authority of Cartagena, attended the “Smart Ports” forum today, May 14. Strategic Management in Andalusian ports” organized by the Port of Malaga and the Junta de Andalucía and with the collaboration of Gas Natural. The objective of the forum is to discuss new ideas and present scientific advances that manage to develop port activity in a more efficient and sustainable way. The participation of the Port Authority of Cartagena in the round table that analyzes “the Smart approach according to the type of port”, and specifically on the supply of Liquefied Natural Gas to ships from the Port itself. An innovative initiative that the Port of Cartagena, Repsol and Enagás carried out for the first time in Europe in April 2017. Liquefied Natural Gas is one of the most ecological alternative fuels in the industry since it does not generate sulfur or particle emissions, and substantially reduces CO2 and Nitrogen Oxide, the famous NOx. For this reason, its use as in maritime transport is being promoted in recent years and more and more actors are betting on it. What differentiates this fuel from traditional Natural Gas? Basically, it is the same “gas” subjected to an extreme cooling process, up to -1600 degrees Celsius, so that it turns into a liquid state. This process is known as liquefaction and it reduces the most harmful compounds for the environment. This is possible because, in the process of cooling the gas, compounds such as sulfur, particles or part of the CO2 disappear. Therefore, we have a much cleaner liquid product that is also easier to transport. While traditional natural gas requires large infrastructure such as gas pipelines, liquefied natural gas can be transported in tanker trucks to areas where fuel is not so easily available. The Port Authority of Cartagena wants to promote an integrated logistics chain that allows LNG to be supplied from the port infrastructures themselves. In this way, what is known as the 'energy mix' is sought; That is, energy consumption that relies on clean fuels and allows us to reduce dependence on traditional hydrocarbons. “Cartagena was the first port in Europe to supply LNG to a ship,” declares Gómez Fuster, “sharing this type of progress with colleagues from other Port Authorities and actors in the sector allows us to continue improving in terms of sustainability.” And Cartagena is the first port that has a regulation for the supply of LNG for ships from a tanker truck. As a reference port in this process, it has innovative facilities prepared to carry out the activity in a safe and efficient way. “Our priority,” concludes Gómez Fuster, “is to increasingly promote the use of this fuel because it is not only more economical but much more respectful of the environment and our surroundings.”",9,102

"6,000 CRUISE SHIPS DORCH IN TWO DAYS AT THE PORT OF CARTAGENA","Cartagena, April 13, 2018.— A total of more than six thousand passengers will visit our city in two days, April 13 and 14, with two “maxi cruises”, the Konigsdam and the Crown Princess. The latter will be the first time it arrives at our port and its 3,100 passengers will be able to check out all the leisure and visit options that Cartagena offers them. The Konigsdam, bound for Rome, docked this morning after a 26-night journey through different ports in Europe. This ship from Holland America Line is characterized by offering extensive trips in different regions of the world. It will not be the first time that he visits our port, since he made a stopover this past Monday and will return on May 5. This shows how Cartagena is becoming more and more established in cruise tourism, since the ships usually return after a first experience. The Crown Princess, from Princess Cruises, will make a stopover in Cartagena for the first time. This company with origins in the United States offers long transatlantic trips. Its arrival, scheduled for eight in the morning, and leaving at two in the afternoon will allow its passengers to enjoy the good weather, the activities available in the city and the shops on our streets. April is going to be one of the largest months in terms of cruise ship arrivals, with 25 ships. For some it will be the first time they visit our coast and others will repeat the experience. Its passengers not only have the city's own offerings but also many other activities such as diving or nautical activities. For the president of the Port Authority, Joaquín Segado, this has a positive impact in many aspects, “the arrival of cruise passengers to the Port of Cartagena not only benefits our organization, but also expands trade opportunities in the city. This task is main for our work since it is essential that citizens benefit from opportunities such as the increase in indirect employment."" The presence at international fairs and the work of the Port Authority of Cartagena are allowing the number of cruise ships that pass through our port to grow more every year. Maintaining these statistics and continuing to improve their reception is part of our main objectives in order to continue actively contributing to both Cartagena and the Region of Murcia.",11,96
Joaquín Segado highlights that “the two blue flags in the Port give an idea of the quality that Cartagena's waters currently have”,"Cartagena, May 13, 2018.— Two blue flags will fly in the Port of Cartagena this summer. And the Real Club de Regatas de Cartagena has achieved the Blue Flag for marinas awarded by the Foundation for Environmental Education every year. This flag joins the one that has already flown in Cala Cortina uninterruptedly since 2007, one of the few Blue Flag beaches on the Cartagena coast. In this way, and until the month of September, these two recognitions will show the good quality and good work carried out by the institutions of the Port of Cartagena. The Port Authority of Cartagena has always wanted to contribute to ensuring that Cala Cortina, one of the busiest beaches in the municipality, has the environmental status necessary to obtain this recognition. To do this, Joaquín Segado highlights, “different actions are carried out to ensure the good quality of its waters.” One of these actions is, for example, the work of the “Pelican”, a special boat that removes waste, most of it plastic, from the surface of the water. Periodic water and sediment quality characterization campaigns are also carried out, within the framework of the Water Quality Control and Surveillance Plan in the Port area; and, in the summer, a floating barrier is installed to prevent possible marine pollution from affecting the beach, a circumstance that has not occurred to date. On the other hand, the awarding of a blue flag to the Regatta Club makes it the first marina in the municipality to achieve this environmental award. Something that, for the Port of Cartagena, is quite an honor since, as its president José García-Bravo declares, the Port Authority of Cartagena has been a key collaborator throughout the process. For Joaquín Segado, obtaining these two flags is “a reason for joy and pride since they give the notion of the quality that our waters currently have and it is thanks to the work carried out by the companies that make up the port community.” These awards, and the work that goes into achieving them, “also allow the people of Cartagena to enjoy beaches and recreational facilities with the greatest guarantees for both leisure and the environment.”",6,50

This forum aims to promote Melilla in the sector and provide knowledge about the cruise industry to local companies and professionals involved in this type of tourism. The event, organized by Cruises News Media Group, an expert consulting company in the cruise industry, was aimed at all professionals in the port sector and auxiliary industries as well as companies in charge of services for cruise passengers. In short, all those who can benefit from the arrival of passengers to their cities. Throughout the day, various informative talks related to the cruise industry took place. Fernando Muñoz, representative of the Port of Cartagena, explained the transformation of the city and the port in recent years. A true success story that consisted of the adaptation of a mainly industrial and military city until it became a benchmark in tourism and services. A work that began in the 80s when Puertos del Estado proposed to integrate the port and the city. This was achieved thanks to the transfer of goods to the outer docks, Santa Lucía, San Pedro and Escombreras, and the construction and rehabilitation of infrastructures such as the Cruise Terminal, the Sea Wall or the Regatta Club. These actions, which began in the 90s, allowed Cartagenans and tourists to enjoy the historical and cultural offerings of the port city. They also marked the roadmap for future actions that will focus on the creation and improvement of service infrastructures that directly and indirectly benefit Cartagena and the Region. Currently, investments continue to be made in improving infrastructure for the city, with various works such as the expansion of the Cruise Terminal that allows simultaneous stops for two 300-meter-long cruise ships. This project, completed in May 2017, involved an investment of more than four million euros. This made it possible for 151 cruise ships to dock in Cartagena last year, disembarking more than two hundred and thirty thousand passengers in the city. This forum and various similar events serve to promote the city of Cartagena and its port services within the sector, in addition to observing and learning from other actions. Fernando Muñoz himself highlighted that the host city “is a destination yet to be discovered, with many cultural and urban similarities with Cartagena.” Our port, the eighth in Spain in terms of cruises, is increasingly a reference in good cruise practices ""not only in our country but internationally.""",9,96

"THE PORT OF CARTAGENA MOBILIZES TRAFFIC OF 96,127 CONTAINERS AND MORE THAN 187,000 CRUISE PASSENGERS IN 2016","This morning the Board of Directors of the Port Authority of Cartagena met in an ordinary session, which was attended by the Minister of Development and Infrastructure of the Region of Murcia, Pedro Rivera. The president of the APC has reported on the volume of traffic that the Port of Cartagena moved during the past year, which continues to break records in terms of general merchandise and container traffic. Specifically, the Port of Cartagena moved traffic of 96,127 TEUs in 2016, which represents an increase of 4.72% compared to the previous year. This marks a growing trend that began in 2015, a year in which container transport grew by 3.4%. As is the case with general merchandise, which grew by 8.69%, reaching 1.39 million tons. In terms of cruises, Cartagena is already in the leading group of the ten main cruise ports in Spain, occupying eighth place. In 2016 there were 121 cruise calls, which represents an increase of 12.04%, and 1,988 ships, 1.69% more. Thus, 187,193 passengers have arrived at the Port of Cartagena, 24.54% more than in 2015. This significant increase is due to the fact that Cartagena became an embarkation port for the first time, a fact that will be repeated this year. Furthermore, the Port of Cartagena has transported 31.72 tons of merchandise in absolute terms, which has meant a slight decrease of 2.27% in relative terms and compared to 2015, already foreseen in the 2016 Business Plan, where estimated a closure of 31.81 million tons (with a deviation of less than 0.3%). This is the third best data in terms of traffic volume in the history of the Port, only surpassed in 2015 and 2014. The decrease has been basically due to the lower volume of liquid bulk, with 25 million tons being moved. through the port, 2.41% less than the previous year, but Cartagena is the second port in terms of liquid bulk traffic only behind Algeciras. The main causes of the decrease in liquid bulk are the scheduled shutdown of the Repsol refinery as well as the decrease in natural gas traffic through the port of Cartagena. This decrease in LNG is due to the increase in gas entry through the MEDGAZ gas pipeline and a regulation of tolls that have not favored the use of the Cartagena facilities as an LNG logistics terminal. For its part, solid bulk traffic stood at 5.32 million tons, with a decrease of 4.14% compared to 2015, due to lower traffic of cereals and iron ore; The latter was punctual in 2015 and practically disappeared in 2016. Special mention deserves livestock trafficking, which with more than 610,241 head shipped and 4.93% above the previous year, places the Port of Cartagena as a reference in the export of live animals. The main destination countries are Libya, Lebanon, Egypt and Algeria; By cabins, the calves, sheep and lambs selected at origin stand out, which are acquired by the client after a meticulous process, since the livestock must comply with Islamic standards that make them suitable for consumption. If we look at the statistics by tons exported, the increase has been 24.94%. The total turnover in 2016, compared to the data from the previous 2015, has decreased by 1.38% in relative terms, placing it in absolute at €41.86 million.

Thus, in 1990, the Port-City Integration Plan of the Port of Cartagena began. The objective of this plan is the transformation of the port lands of the Alfonso XII Dock into an urban area, thus opening the city to the sea. To this end, the port tasks of loading, unloading and storage that were previously carried out in this area were previously transferred to the Santa Lucía and San Pedro docks, thus freeing up the land and the sheet of water on which the operations were carried out. different actions that were included within this plan: Construction of a Marina: 5 pontoons with space for 400 boats up to 12 meters in length (1994). Reorganization of traffic and creation of a boulevard along the entire pier and on the Cuesta del Batel: roads, sidewalks and gardens (1997). Rehabilitation and enhancement of the Wall of Charles III (or Sea Wall), BIC from the 18th century, on its maritime façade (2000). Construction of the new headquarters building for the Real Club de Regatas de Cartagena (2000). Construction of the Cruise Terminal (2001). Later expanded on several occasions. Construction of an underground parking lot with capacity for 650 vehicles (2001). Other actions that do not fall within this plan but follow these same objectives: Construction of a marina for yachts from 12 meters in length (2005). Reconstruction of the Old Regatta Club (2006). Urbanization of the surroundings of the La Curra Lighthouse (lighthouse, esplanade, gym equipment, area for fishermen) (2013).

"" And as such, it must adapt to the needs of its users, and that is why it is currently undergoing renovation: on the one hand, it has improved vehicle access to the Cruise Terminal, eliminating the curves that make it difficult. arrival of buses transporting passengers. The commercial gallery of the Marina has also been eliminated, thus gaining a necessary esplanade for the multiple events that need space to be held in this environment.

The cruise has not only changed the tourism concept, offering comfort, safety and attractions, but it increasingly promotes shore excursions to archaeological, cultural and artistic sites, thus supporting the national heritage. Passengers enjoy the ship and also enjoy the cities. Cartagena continues in the wake of its port, growing as a tourist city and offering its heritage and services to all visitors who pass through it.",8,94
THE PORT OF CARTAGENA ADDRESSES THE USES OF LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS.,"Representatives of maritime, rail and road transport have participated in the conference organized by the Port of Cartagena, Enagás and GASNAM to promote the use of natural gas as an alternative to other types of fuels in transport. This Conference aims to be a meeting between LNG producers and marketers, logistics operators and marine, rail and road transport operators where each of them has presented their vision to facilitate the use of this fuel in their business activity. The day is divided into four sections dedicated, the first, to the impact of gas on the economy and the environment, as well as its use as transportation; the second as fuel in maritime transport; the third in land transport (by road and rail); and, the fourth will end with the intervention of the general director of Energy and Industrial and Mining Activity of the Regional Government, who will address the evolution and future of natural gas in the Region. This aims to contribute to the development of the use of natural gas in transportation as a realistic alternative to other fuels, with less environmental impact and more economical. Among the priorities of the Port of Cartagena is to increase freight traffic, LNG being one of those that presents the most immediate possibilities for development and which also respects the port's priorities: quality, safety and care for the environment. Antonio Sevilla has indicated ""that is why new logistics services have been developed, and continue to be improved, to meet market requirements and position Cartagena as an LNG logistics hub."" For his part, the General Director of Infrastructure of Enagás, Cludio Rodríguez, has highlighted the company's more than 45 years of experience in the sector. “With eight regasification plants, such as the one in Cartagena, the Iberian Peninsula has a privileged geostrategic position and has developed extensive knowhow in the development of logistics solutions, which are key to the promotion of LNG as an alternative fuel in transportation,” has pointed out. The APC has been the first in Spain to have an approved regulation for the supply of LNG to ships from tanker trucks. In addition, the Port Authority of Cartagena participates in a project to develop a supply chain for refueling at sea, of liquefied natural gas (LNG), in the Spanish Mediterranean basin, a project that has obtained European financing through the funds for the development of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-t Funds). In this sense, the President has indicated that ""it is currently the reference port for LNG bunkering in the Mediterranean, and we want to consolidate this position, promoting the use of a more efficient fuel such as LNG."" The port's port facilities, with two independent berths, and industrial facilities allow it to offer top quality services, both for LNG supply and loading and unloading operations, as well as new LNG operations such as small-scale and transit. (which could turn Cartagena into an LNG HUB). To date, supply operations have been carried out to the Kvitbjorn ship, the largest general cargo ship that has refueled this type of fuel, and to several tugboats. The commitment to the new opportunities of LNG (it is the title of the day) is a joint commitment by Enagás and the APC, and proof of this is the joint actions for the promotion of LNG reflected in the agreement that was signed in December 2014 and joint participation in the LNG HIVE project, co-financed with CEF funds. Manuel Lage, President of GASNAM, has highlighted the important role that Cartagena plays for this type of fuel, since it has a privileged position and the appropriate infrastructure for supply, unloading and distribution. The APC's commitment continues to be working together with producers and operators to promote this type of fuel. In addition, it must be taken into account that by 2020 ships have to use a less polluting fuel than fuel oil. It is a requirement by the International Maritime Organization and the European Union. One of the alternatives is Liquefied Natural Gas. For this reason, Cartagena wants to play a relevant role in the global expansion of the LNG market as an alternative fuel for ships, but also for road and rail transport.",14,78

CARTAGENA SELLS ITS EXPERIENCE IN OPTIMIZATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF GREEN OPERATIONS IN AMERICA.,"The president and general director of the Port Authority of Cartagena attend the XXVI Latin American Ports Congress, which is taking place this week in Punta del Este (Uruguay). Antonio Sevilla has participated in the panel “The perspectives of bulk terminals” together with Pablo Pussetto (Argentina) and Nicholas Ingle (England) and in the talks on special bulk projects: Tessa Major (Antwerp), Ramón RullMagre (Barcelona) and Rodolfo Sabonge. In his presentation he explained how the environmental policies that have been initiated in the Port of Cartagena, involving all the companies installed in its docks, have contributed to the improvement of the port environment. He noted that: “environmental improvements have contributed to placing the Port of Cartagena as the fourth port in Spain in terms of freight traffic and to being the most profitable in the system.” In addition to publicizing the facilities through a promotional video and explaining the facilities, traffic, and integration projects with its closest environment, it has also announced the initiatives carried out to become the most sustainable port in the Mediterranean. and remain the most profitable. And this is in line with the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) as a differentiating element and with the conviction that they are an effective communication tool and the opportunity that they represent for the business and institutional sector. Sevilla indicated that “the geostrategic position of the Port of Cartagena, in a privileged location for transoceanic routes and allows us to be in one of the main reference axes of European and world maritime trade. The main world trade lines pass next to the Port of Cartagena. This and the efforts made in infrastructure have made us the first Spanish port in bulk traffic, moving almost 32 million tons last year, of which 95% are bulk."" The president has highlighted the initiatives that the institution is carrying out to minimize the effects of handling bulk, including an operational semi-ecological hopper, and another one in modification, which have allowed a proven reduction in emissions of 75%; as well as the combination of traffic reorganization measures and physical measures (6 meter high walls and irrigation cisterns) to reduce dust clouds. Another measure adopted in unloading or loading solid bulk operations is to place a 12 x 10 meter tarp, covering the area of action of the crane's bucket. In this way, it is achieved that even though the buckets are already watertight, any loss of merchandise falls onto the canvas and not into the sea. The actions adopted also focus on innovation in the use of new materials in infrastructure, such as the use of fiber-reinforced polymer bars for the reinforcement of concrete structures, which presents a series of advantages compared to the use of steel bars, becoming in a very promising alternative especially in the case of reinforced concrete structures in aggressive environments, such as coastal areas and marine environments. Today there is no shoulder with this type of fiberglass reinforced polymers. In his presentation, he also addressed the main growth objective of the Port of Cartagena, for the coming years, the implementation of the new El Gorguel Dock. Located a short distance from the Escombreras dock, it will allow, with a draft of between 25 and 30 meters, to accommodate the largest container ships and take advantage of the privileged location of Cartagena to promote a HUB that also allows entry and exit of the company's products. Region of Murcia, the second province with the most foreign trade in Spain. The Congress has brought together more than 400 representatives of the Latin American shipping sector who have addressed the future perspectives of the maritime industry, how digital development affects the activity, as well as the optimization and sustainability of port operations.",14,155
Joaquín Segado: “strengthening collaboration between the Port and the central administration is a priority”,"Cartagena, April 17, 2018.— The president of the Port Authority of Cartagena has held the first meeting with the government delegate in the Region of Murcia, Francisco Bernabé. In it, topics of importance for the work of the Port were discussed, such as the different railway infrastructure works, safety in the facilities and the status of the Port of Cartagena as the fourth most important in Spain. The railway works carried out in the Escombreras dock and the Camarillas variant have been the main topics discussed. For Francisco Bernabé ""these works will improve Cartagena's connections not only with the interior of the peninsula but also along the coast and to the rest of Europe."" He also highlighted that the work is being carried out within the planned deadlines and with great agility. For President Joaquín Segado, these two works are “the most important for the connections of Cartagena and the Region.” Regarding the Camarillas variant, he highlights that ""up to thirty minutes of travel time will be saved, something that will indirectly benefit passengers who use the road."" The work in the Escombreras dock will allow “ships to unload directly onto the train and the train, on a platform, to leave directly from the Port.” On the topic of security, the celebration of a summit is announced that brings together the efforts of the Port Authorities, the security forces of the Region of Murcia, companies that work in the port field, captaincy, maritime rescue and the Navy. For Joaquín Segado, these efforts are basic, “especially now that the cruise season begins.” At this summit we will work mainly with security protocols, monitoring them in detail. The Government delegate, Francisco Bernabé, has highlighted that these types of meetings are very important since they “trace the work paths between the Port of Cartagena, through State Ports and the Ministry of Development, and the Government's actions in benefit of Cartagena, the region and the Region of Murcia.” For the Port of Cartagena, and in the words of its president, it is important to “strengthen collaboration with the central administration, of which it is a part.” These types of meetings allow us to monitor the work carried out and open new actions on various topics of great importance, such as in the case of security.",8,65

COFIDES and the Port Authority will sign a collaboration agreement,"The president of the Spanish Development Financing Company, COFIDES, SA, SME, Salvador Marín, held a working meeting today with the president of the Port Authority of Cartagena, Antonio Sevilla, to establish possible collaboration formulas to support companies in their international activity. At this meeting, the president of COFIDES, Salvador Marín, in his strategy of taking COFIDES abroad, has proposed to the president of the Port Authority of Cartagena the signing of a collaboration agreement so that a permanent channel can be established of financial information to companies that use the services of the port of Cartagena in their international scope. The objective is, according to Marín, “for both institutions to share their experience in the field of internationalization in order to promote the foreign expansion of Spanish companies, thus contributing to the development of the economy and the Port of Cartagena itself.” . “There are many Spanish companies that choose the Port of Cartagena to transport their products abroad and we want to study all the options to enhance our possibilities for collaboration and make it easier for companies to develop their internationalization strategies,” explained the president of COFIDES. The president of the Port Authority, Antonio Sevilla, has indicated that “the joint work of both institutions will contribute to the development of the Port of Cartagena and, therefore, that of the entire Region of Murcia. It is about generating wealth for all the citizens of the region and having a tool like COFIDES is a guarantee of success.” Seville also recalled that the port of Cartagena is one of the most important economic engines for the Region since more than 80% of the imports that arrive in the Autonomous Community do so through the port, through which 60% of the exports. COFIDES is a public-private company that since 1988 has offered financial support for investments by Spanish companies abroad. It exclusively manages the FIEX and FONPYME funds on behalf of the Secretary of State for Commerce, attached to the Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness.

The Port in DIATIC 18,"Cartagena, May 18, 2018.- The Port of Cartagena was present at the events held on May 17 and 18 on the occasion of Information and Communication Technologies Day. Various talks and presentations were held on the sector and a closing gala in which Juan Antonio Sánchez, head of the Information Systems department, was nominated for “telecommunications engineer of the year”, coming in second place in the vote in which the members participate. These sessions seek to disseminate information about the incorporation of ICT in the tourism sector of our region. With this, all the latest developments and current technologies that can best be integrated into the field are made known and, in this way, common work synergies are found. The Port Authority of Cartagena participates as one of the sponsors of the conference and in the various activities that will be carried out during both days. At the Tourism Qualification Center, various “workshops” will be held between local administrations, tourism schools, associations and companies. The closing of this edition will be at the “ICT Day 2018 Gala Dinner and Awards Ceremony”, which took place at the 7 Coronas Hotel, on Friday, May 18 at 9:00 p.m. There our colleague Juan Antonio Sánchez, along with other relevant workers in the Murcian IT sector, went in recognition of his work in integrating these technologies in the Port of Cartagena. The development of the tourism sector including new ICT is a high priority in port work. Cartagena is a reference port in terms of tourism and cruises, and work is done every day to improve its facilities and services. In this regard, information and communication technologies allow us to speed up work and obtain better results. For Juan Antonio Sánchez “being recognized in events of this type is not only a personal pride but a demonstration that good work is being done in the Port of Cartagena. Our objectives always go hand in hand with the incorporation of new technologies that allow us to grow and provide better service.”",8,80
THE PORT OF CARTAGENA BEGINS 2018 BY STRENGTHENING ITS COMMITMENT TO ERADICATING MARINE TRASH,"Cartagena, April 12, 2018.— Every year the seas and oceans of our planet receive more than 8 million tons of garbage. This means that every second that passes we throw about 200 kilos of all kinds of garbage into the sea, although, by far, the majority (between 60 and 80%) is plastic waste. This situation has become a real problem for humanity that affects one of its most sensitive ecosystems, the marine one. The United Nations itself includes it as one of the challenges to be solved through the SDGs (the Sustainable Development Goals), which have been assumed by the Port Authority of Cartagena within its commitment to sustainable development. Cartagena, and more specifically its port, is no stranger to this great problem. In fact, the Port Authority of Cartagena (APC) has had a Pelican-type vessel dedicated exclusively to collecting solid waste from the port's water surface for more than a decade. This is a pelican-type boat with front claws that open to collect the debris found. For Joaquín Segado, president of APC, “the port's work to combat this serious problem has always been very active, the daily work of this vessel ensured that in 2016 5,160 tons of garbage were collected in the Port of Cartagena. However, during 2017 this figure has increased significantly, with the volume collected being 7,800 tons of waste. A fact that, without a doubt, should make us all reflect to continue insisting on the need to not throw garbage into the sea. We believe that the obligation to improve our education and environmental awareness so that waste does not reach the sea is increasingly imperative.” Plastics are once again the most numerous waste in the Port of Cartagena, with more than 63.98% of the total collected, followed far behind by wood with 25.01%. The month with the most garbage collected in 2017 was May, with 1,120 tons in a single month, followed by December, with 1,100 tons. The Mediterranean, one of the most affected seas Our sea, the Mediterranean, is one of the most affected by the problem of marine litter. Only 15% of the dumped garbage reaches the beach, and 70% of the waste sinks, causing serious problems in marine ecosystems. We cannot forget that a plastic bottle can take up to 500 years to degrade, so we can imagine the very high impact of each one that is thrown into the sea. The main problem with marine litter is its high dispersion and persistence. These factors cause the plastics that reach the marine environment to generate bags of waste, capable of putting extensive areas of aquatic ecosystems at risk. Derived from this situation, the problem posed by microplastics is added. These small particles derive from the plastic that is consumed and used (as packaging, exfoliants and thickeners, among others) and can end up adhering to the internal tissues of animals and, in this way, enter the food chain. The impacts of this problem are both socioeconomic, environmental and public health. For this reason, from the Port of Cartagena, we continue fighting to achieve zero discharge into our seas and oceans through initiatives such as our pelican-type boat, and promoting society's awareness of this serious problem, with marine waste collection campaigns. . If you want to know the importance of caring for the marine environment, you will find more information in Goal 14: The world's oceans – their temperature, chemistry, currents and life – move systems that make the Earth habitable for humanity. http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/es/oceans/",14,105
THE PORT AUTHORITY OF CARTAGENA CONSOLIDATES ITS NATIONAL LEADERSHIP AS THE MOST PROFITABLE PORT IN SPAIN FOR THE SIXTH CONSECUTIVE YEAR.,"The Region of Murcia consolidates its leadership at the national level with the most profitable port in Spain for the sixth consecutive year. The Port of Cartagena registered the highest profitability index of all Spanish ports in 2016, with 7.13 percent, which is more than triple the country's average (2.05 percent, according to provisional data). The Minister of Development and Infrastructure, Pedro Rivera, highlighted the “good evolution of the regional port industry”, after the Board of Directors of the Port of Cartagena, in which the accounts for the 2016 financial year were approved, and pointed out that these “magnificent data ""They will attract new investments and the application of more competitive rates for the sector."" ""In the last two years, the regional government has made a firm commitment to the Port of Cartagena as a reference in cruises and merchandise traffic, which is reflected in the continued growth of this infrastructure, which places us as one of the most active from all over Spain,” Rivera highlighted. The counselor stated that the regional government “will continue to value the peripheral location of the Region to be the gateway for entry and exit of goods from Europe, through the Port of Cartagena, to strengthen a solid, sustainable, efficient and profitable model.” ""which will be fundamental in the growth of the Region."" Positive evolution The positive evolution of the Port of Cartagena in recent years has allowed it to achieve a net turnover of 41.99 million euros, which represents a profit of 18.27 million euros, thanks largely to merchandise traffic . According to Antonio Sevilla, “the Port has consolidated its operating line, and despite the slight decrease in freight traffic during 2016, due to the technical stoppage of the Repsol refinery and lower LNG consumption, the economic result has barely changed. ”. The Region maintains its position within the group of the top five ports in Spain with the highest freight traffic and which in 2016 moved a total of 31.88 million tons. This figure is the third best data in terms of traffic volume in the history of the Region. The operating result was 18.01 million euros, with operating income of 45.61 million compared to expenses of 27.60 million. Furthermore, the Port of Cartagena is one of the five ports that contributes the most to the Interport Compensation Fund, with 1.44 million euros annually, an instrument of territorial cohesion that contributes to balancing the economic balance of the ports. In the session held today, Admiral Aniceto Rosique Nieto joined as a member, representing the General Administration of the State and replacing Marcial Gamboa Pérez-Pardo. A 4-month extension has also been approved to complete the works on the water intake of the desalination plant and the tender for the project “Recrecado espaldón dam Suroeste de Escombreras”, for an amount of €1,996,389 (VAT included).",8,98
Joaquín Segado “the opening of the Roman Theater was a turning point in attracting cruise tourists.,"Cartagena, May 11, 2018.— This project, which was approved by the board of trustees of the Roman Theater Foundation of Cartagena, formed by the Autonomous Community, the Cartagena City Council and the Cajamurcia Foundation, in December 2016, has had as its objective the improving the quality of visits with the application of new technologies for the recreation of the past through augmented reality and virtual reality, developed with the company “Imageen”. Starting May 11, visitors will be able to travel to Carthago Nova and live a completely immersive experience thanks to virtual reality. The startup specialized in historical VR and the Roman Theater Museum of Cartagena have carried out a unique project to virtually recreate the original architectural complex from the 1st century BC. C., in collaboration with the Port Authority of Cartagena. This system of virtual visits to the Roman Theater Museum of Cartagena is based on the use of different virtual reality and 360-degree mobile devices. It is an immersive experience in which the visitor, when accessing the monument, can view the same building reconstructed as it was in Roman times through glasses. In addition to this immersion, there is an audio explanation in English or Spanish about the transition from the present to the past with details of the different architectural elements and the life of the theater. Imageen, leader in the cultural tourism sector based on the virtual recreation of the past, and the Roman Theater Museum of Cartagena, present the new virtual reality project that recreates, in great detail and virtually, this architectural complex dating back to the years 5 and 1 a. C. A project available from May 11 and that allows visitors to relive the era of splendor that the Roman Theater of Cartagena had, one of the most important in the world. The project has been assigned to the European Year of Cultural Heritage as an activity of technological innovation. Through VR glasses, available in the Museum facilities, guided tours of the Museum will be carried out for groups. At the end of the tour you will be able to enjoy the architectural recreations of yesteryear and live an immersive experience in ancient Carthago Nova. This is a unique project in Spain and is considered the first practical implementation of virtual reality used to visit an archaeological site. When viewing the 3D recreation of the monument in great detail, the user can do so in two different ways. One of them is through virtual reality glasses that the Museum makes available to users for a price of 10 euros included in the guided tours, which will take place on Saturdays and Sundays at 11:30 a.m. Also through their personal smartphones or tablets, by downloading the Imageen-Cartagena app, from the Apple Store or Google Play, for only 2.5 euros the user will be able to view the virtual recreation. The mobile application thus becomes the key tool to immerse the visitor in the era of Roman Cartagena thanks to visualizing this unique architectural complex from 22 centuries ago. It can mainly be observed from the virtual viewing points marked in the Museum, from which the monument can be seen in its current state combined with the virtual view of the monument. All of this recreated with a hyper-realistic quality thanks to Imageen's virtual reality expertise. Thus, the 'traveler to the past' can see what the cavea was originally like, a semicircular structure in which the spectators, the orchestra or stage, the scaena frons or stage facade, and the porticus post scaenam, a porticoed gallery that surrounds a space, were located. landscaped and which constitutes one of the distinctive elements of Roman theatrical architecture. The app also has a virtual guide who accompanies the traveler during the visit and explains, in Spanish or English, the transition from the past to the present, as well as the different architectural elements and the activity of the Theater in its time. In addition, visitors also have a video of about two minutes long about the place and an immersive virtual flight through the entire site. Imageen, together with the Museum's recommendations, has recorded an excerpt from a play of the time, a small mime, where the actors did not wear masks, which has been incorporated into the guided tour and can be observed from one of the points virtual viewing of the theater, although we will also see them act in a tragedy, where the actors used masks for both female and male roles. The Port Authority of Cartagena, which collaborates in this project, has been working for 20 years to develop cruise tourism in the city and promoting the Region of Murcia as a tourist destination so that cruise passengers can take excursions during their stopover in the port. In these years it has collaborated with the city, the region and businessmen to consolidate Cartagena as a tourist reference for the shipping industry. Joaquín Segado, president of the Port Authority of Cartagena: “the opening of the Roman Theater 10 years ago was a turning point in attracting cruise tourists. In 2008, the year of its inauguration, the Port received 35,000 cruise passengers, which doubled the following year, reaching 237,000 last year. But we must continue working on the consolidation of the Cartagena brand as a tourist destination, so collaboration between all the agents involved is essential."" Since the opening of the Roman Theater Museum in 2008, it has become the symbol that best represents the city of Cartagena. The Port Authority has seen this and has used it as the main claim for shipping companies to include the city in the itineraries of their ships, so it collaborates in this project due to the great interest that shipping companies have in being able to offer exclusive excursions. , innovative and that provide a more attractive experience for its passengers.",11,17
The Port Authority of Cartagena and the University of Murcia and the Polytechnic University of Cartagena show their commitment to the environment.,"The president of the Port Authority of Cartagena and the rectors of the University of Murcia and the Polytechnic of Cartagena have signed the contracts for research projects selected by the Permanent Commission of the Interuniversity Chair of the Environment, with the aim of promoting and carrying out studies and multidisciplinary investigations on environmental matters in the surroundings of the Port of Cartagena and that, in turn, can be used in the management of the Port Authority of Cartagena. The bases were published on the websites of the three institutions in March of this year and were aimed at researchers from both universities in the Region whose work can contribute to the development of knowledge in the port field and related to the Natura 2000 Network, biodiversity and responsible management. of species and habitat, underwater noise, marine pollution, and contaminated soils. 12 proposals were submitted to this call and four were selected. Underwater noise monitoring using Autonomous Underwater Vehicles. Integration of an intelligent hydrophone in an AUV IVER2_Ecomapper, whose directors are professors Javier Gilabert Cervera and José Luis Sancho Gómez from the UPCT, consists of the design and implementation of an underwater acoustic monitoring system with the characteristic of being mobile and autonomous , which represents an increase in possibilities for measuring all types of underwater noise. This system will allow the measurement of underwater noise, characterize and evaluate the variations; It will provide the data to make a precise noise map of larger areas; will allow cetaceans to be automatically detected based on their sounds; etc., 28,444.96 euros have been allocated to this project. The project Environmental diagnosis, risk analysis and definition of corrective measures in abandoned sludge deposits on Rambla del Avenque (Cartagena), has a budget of 28,385.18 euros and is directed by UPCT professor Ángel Faz Cano. It consists of the preparation of an environmental diagnosis of two flotation sludge deposits located on Rambla del Avenque, from a hydrological, geophysical and geochemical point of view. An environmental risk analysis will be carried out and corrective measures will be proposed to reduce the risks that are detected. It is focused on mining waste deposits, characteristic of the Sierra Minera, with high concentrations of heavy metals. For her part, Pilar de la Rúa Tarin, from the University of Murcia, will be responsible for directing the proposal for the Evaluation of pollination and seed dispersal networks as key factors for the conservation of habitat 5220* on the coast of Cartagena. It will be focused on the study of the two most important interaction networks between plant-animal: pollination and seed dispersal, as well as its key role in the conservation of the priority habitat of arborescent scrub in the Sierra de la Fausilla. Its purpose is to establish a diagnosis of the current state of conservation and future prospects of this habitat in one of the few representative areas of it in the Spanish southeast. It has a budget of 19,849.52 euros. The study focuses on two of the representative species of this habitat, Ziziphus lotus (jujube) and Maytenus senegalensis (hawthorn), both classified as vulnerable in the Region of Murcia. Analysis of the population structure and captive breeding of the long-snouted seahorse Hippocampus guttulatus, a proposal directed by José Galián Albaladejo from the University of Murcia, will have an amount of 19,828.8 euros for the design of conservation programs for the long-snouted seahorse. sea, common in the Mar Menor and that due to the gradual deterioration that the lagoon has suffered in recent decades has led to a significant decrease in its population in this habitat. Although it is a species distributed in areas of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, due to its limited mobility combined with its location in the Mar Menor, it suggests that the reproductive exchange of this species with open sea populations could be limited, so it is It is necessary to determine whether the population of seahorses in the lagoon has its own genetic peculiarities that justify greater protection since it is a peculiar and endemic population of the biotope. All these projects are part of the agreement signed in July of last year and launched by the Port Authority of Cartagena, aware that permanent work must be carried out on the Environment, recognizing and promoting environmental values, the habitats of their environment and the floristic and faunal elements that could inhabit them. Therefore, it was considered necessary to launch an Environment Chair with the Polytechnic University of Cartagena and the University of Murcia, through the “Mare Nostrum 37/38” Campus of International Excellence, aimed at channeling R&D+ actions.

THE PORT OF CARTAGENA SUPPORTS A RESEARCH PROJECT ON THE MOST COMMON SEAHORSE OF THE MAR MENOR,"The Port Authority of Cartagena (APC) is supporting an ambitious research project that aims to study the population structure and captive breeding of one of the most common marine animals in the Mar Menor, the long-snouted seahorse Hippocampus guttulatus. “Research on this type of seahorse, like the rest of the projects developed by the chair, is part of one of the fundamental lines of our corporate social responsibility policy; the care of our natural environment. We are surrounded by a body of water that has a habitat that must be conserved. The project “Analysis of the population structure and captive breeding of the long-snouted seahorse Hippocampus guttulatus” is directed by Professor José Galián Albadalejo. Its main objective is the design of conservation programs for this very common marine species in the Mar Menor and which, due to the gradual deterioration that the water surface has suffered in recent decades, has considerably reduced its presence in this very important ecosystem of our region. The research, which is currently underway, wants to determine if the population of horseies in the lagoon has its own genetic peculiarities that justify greater protection, since it is a peculiar species endemic to this natural biotope. As with other types of marine fauna, the main threats to the seahorse are the destruction of coastal habitats, the pollution of coastal lagoons and estuaries, and selective collection for decorative or aquarium purposes. This is just one example of the actions undertaken by the Port of Cartagena to endorse its clear commitment to the development of a port activity that is compatible with the conservation of biodiversity, in line with objective No. 14 of the Sustainable Development Goals set. by the United Nations. “We believe that we have a responsibility to the conservation and sustainable use of all marine resources. The sea is our natural habitat and we must take care of it, minimizing our impact as much as possible. Our strategy for 2030 is to become the most sustainable port in the Mediterranean and instruments such as the APC-Campus Mare Nostrum Chair help us successfully follow that path.” In addition to this research project, the Port Authority of Cartagena has also undertaken numerous projects to improve and conserve the environment, both terrestrial and maritime. “In our sphere of influence we have up to five protected natural spaces and our intention is to take care of them and improve them every day.”",14,120
THE PORT OF CARTAGENA CELEBRATES WORLD OCEANS DAY TODAY,"“Our oceans, our future”, this is the motto with which the UN celebrates World Oceans Day today, June 8. The Port of Cartagena joins this celebration that seeks to raise awareness about the great role they play in our lives since they are the true lungs of the earth, generating most of the oxygen we consume and absorbing about 25% of the carbon emissions that we consume. we generate. The oceans make up 70% of the Earth's surface but only 1% of its surface is protected. The United Nations highlights the need for sustainable management that allows them to be recovered since, among other things, they are a fundamental element in climate regulation. The preservation of the marine ecosystem is one of the main objectives of the sustainable management policy developed by the Port of Cartagena, one of the first in Spain to have an entity adhered to the EMAS registry and a finalist last year in the ESPO Award for the European port. more sustainable in terms of biodiversity. During 2016, the APC removed more than 5,160 tons of solid waste from the port's waters, 66% of which were plastic, and each month a rigorous sampling process is followed to evaluate the quality of the waters thanks to an agreement signed with the CARM. An excellent indicator of the good condition of the port's waters is that the presence of the “nacra” mollusk, Pinna nobilis, has been detected. This is a species that only appears in clean waters and this is confirmed by environmental authorities, who have described the ecological and chemical status of the port's waters as good. The Port of Cartagena also has within its scope the Cala Cortina beach which, once again, has revalidated the Blue Flag awarded by the European Union, demonstrating that economic development and environmental protection are perfectly compatible. Without a doubt, the deployment of the anti-pollution barrier in summer is a guarantee of protection for this natural area. The work of conservation and protection of the oceans concerns us all and from the Port of Cartagena we renew our commitment on World Day to contribute our grain of sand to this purpose that is included in the Millennium SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals). .",14,117

Some of the most notable presences have been those of José María Albarracín, president of CROEM; the president of the El Pozo group, Tomás Fuertes; the president of Mercadona, Juan Roig; the president of Bankia, Ignacio Goirigolzarri; or the president of the Puig Group, Marc Puig, among others. During the day, information was provided on the “The Mediterranean Corridor” project. Through the projection of a video, the level of execution of the works was shown and gave way to a round table in which the importance of the Corridor was discussed. Likewise, the new communication channel and the website www.elcorredormediterraneo.com have been presented, where all the content related to the Mediterranean Corridor can be viewed. The president of AVE, Vicente Boluda, has been in charge of presenting the project that aims to link the south of Europe with the north with a 3,500 km railway network, intended to reduce transport times by almost half, as well as to improve train frequency and boost tourism. This project is aimed at promoting connections between the port of Cartagena and other ports in the Spanish Mediterranean, and its logistics and industrial areas. As of today, the direct connection of Cartagena and its Port, the fourth in the country in freight traffic, with the Mediterranean Corridor remains to be defined. It is planned that this connection will be made on a double platform of international width and without the need to pass through Murcia. The general director of the Port Authority, Fermín Rol, has stated that this connection will not only facilitate the mobility of travelers, which will result in an increase in tourism, but will also allow the mobility of goods that will result in more exports. “We are convinced that the data that supports the Port of Cartagena as the fourth Spanish port in terms of merchandise volume will improve with the rail corridor,” stated Fermín Rol. Likewise, he pointed out that the connection of ports with the land transportation network is a fundamental element for integration into the dynamics of growth and job creation. The Mediterranean Corridor is a double high-speed railway that will run from the French border to Algeciras, linking such important cities as Barcelona, Valencia, Alicante, Murcia and Malaga and connecting them in turn with the rest of Europe. The Mediterranean Corridor will reduce travel times between important cities such as Barcelona, Valencia, Alicante, Murcia, Almería, Málaga or Algeciras by almost half and even more in some sections. Domestic tourism, weekend trips and work trips will multiply along the entire route.",10,58

EICM students learn about the latest techniques for recycling demolition waste and producing 'green' cement in Áridos Barinas and Cementos La Cruz,"group of students from the Bachelor's Degree in Civil Engineering and the Master's Degree in Civil Engineering from the UPCT have recently visited the recycled aggregates plant, obtained from construction and demolition waste, of the company Áridos y Prefabricados Barinas, in Abanilla. In this outing that complements their theoretical studies, the students also had the opportunity to see the facilities of the Cementos la Cruz 'green' cement manufacturing plant, located in the same municipality. According to a UN study on the global situation of buildings and construction 2022, the sector was responsible for more than 34 percent of energy demand and around 37 percent of CO2 emissions associated with energy and its operations. It is not surprising, therefore, that the development of 'green' cements is considered in a prospective study by MIT as one of the ten great technological challenges of our society, along with the advance in stem cell engineering, or that of electronic implants, among others. For every ton of cement produced, approximately one ton of CO2 is emitted. In fact, cement production accounts for about 10 percent of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. Which has motivated “circular technology” and the quantification of “eco” through sustainability indices and life cycle analysis to have fully entered the world of cement. The recycling of materials for use as aggregates for concrete, pavement or fillers, along with the manufacture of 'green' cements, which achieve a reduction in CO2 emissions of up to 50 percent, are measures that are already working in the Region. of Murcia. So the students have been able to learn first-hand about this cutting-edge technology that represents a first step towards the circular economy in the sector and the achievement of the objectives of the European Green Deal. These companies offered information to future engineers about new production methods for advanced cements and the development of cements with a lower carbon footprint that they are already working on in their plants.",8,2

The UPCT and the Spanish Volunteer Platform will create a virtual reality game and an app to disseminate the SDGs among university students,"The Polytechnic University of Cartagena (UPCT) and the Spanish Volunteering Platform (PVE) are working today on a new project to understand and encourage the interest of the student community in the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) proposed by the WHO. as well as propose new actions to promote the involvement of the youth population in the challenges involved in achieving these objectives. This project called ODSERVA, which lasts one year, is possible thanks to the financing obtained from the Ministry of Social Rights, Consumption and Agenda 2030. The rector of the UPCT, Beatriz Miguel, presented the initiative today together with the president of the PVE and president of the Third Sector Platform, Luciano Poyato. At the event, the rector explained that the ODSERVA experimental project is the first of the initiatives that has been launched as a result of the collaboration between the two entities. As stated, “to facilitate the development of the 2030 Strategy, it is essential to know and investigate the concern and implication that these objectives generate on the youth population and we will work in the coming months to design the tools that allow us to know aggregate results through a virtual tour of each of them.” ODSERVA includes the creation of a digital Virtual Reality (VR) tool and an APP that makes it easier for students to take a tour of the different SDGs and the 2030 Agenda, through a dynamic methodology adjusted to their preferences and capabilities as users. It is about knowing first-hand the interest they have in the SDGs, analyzing the extent to which their habits and behaviors are committed to their fulfillment. The new VR tool, compatible with the development of an APP, is suitable for carrying out this promotional work since it has been proven that learning used using VR is much more effective than the classic transmission of knowledge. The use of surveys or classic methodologies for collecting information generates signs of rejection in the user that tend to make the processes difficult and this situation is more evident as the target population approaches younger ages, as is the case of digital natives. The analysis of the results of ODSERVA will allow us to propose efficient alternatives to design new actions that increase the involvement of the youth population with the SDGs. Thus, the analysis of individual responses can serve to establish a roadmap that improves the level of user commitment. These types of suggested activities will take into account those volunteer actions that are directly linked, as well as information and guidelines for incorporation into your life and daily routine. At the same time, with the aggregated results of ODSERVA, the UPCT and the PVE will have very valuable information that will help decide what strategic actions should be undertaken to grow interest in the SDGs in cases in which greater disinterest. For this program to have an adequate and powerful design, young students must actively participate throughout the project, both in the ideation phase and in the initial implementation and evaluation phases. Without this participation, there is a risk of producing a product of little interest to the group towards which it is directed. The rector added that “the Polytechnic University of Cartagena is leading the ODSERVA project, but through the Spanish Volunteer Platform there will be collaboration with other universities from the rest of Spain in the piloting phases of the tool. VR, since the objective is to generate a product that can be shared and used by the entire university population.”",14,157

doctoral thesis proposes new spatial indicators to evaluate diffuse territorial anthropization,"The doctoral thesis carried out by UPCT doctor Gloria Martínez Mari has analyzed the phenomenon of diffuse territorial anthropization (human impact on the natural environment) in the Region of Murcia and in the other regions of the Mediterranean arc, also evaluating what its effects have been. derived during the last decades in different case studies such as the surroundings of the metropolitan area of the city of Murcia, the Campo de Cartagena area and the coast of the Mar Menor. The research carried out develops indicators that allow evaluating derivatives of this phenomenon in aspects such as urban dispersion, the impact of infrastructure, or the different effects of changes in land use. As the new UPCT doctor explains, “we have used geostatistical analysis tools to study what is the relationship between the actions of soil transformation associated with territorial anthropization and other current phenomena such as the increased vulnerability of the territory to floods or the deterioration of the landscape. Professor Salvador García-Ayllón Veintimilla, director of the doctoral thesis, assures that “it is a currently cutting-edge spatial analysis methodology that had practically not been applied until now for the evaluation of complex phenomena such as diffuse territorial anthropization, whose unexpected derivatives Many times they are unknown by society and administrations.” In the opinion of this researcher, responsible for the R&D group of Territorial Policy, Environmental Planning and Infrastructure of the UPCT, “it is necessary to develop new territorial planning tools that address these phenomena, since the development began two decades ago of many instruments of territorial planning by the regional administration, which however, as demonstrated in the thesis, due to its lack of administrative flexibility and excessive bureaucratization, were never completed, being currently very necessary in many areas of our territory. ”.",13,98

Reading of the manifesto of the Network of Equality Units against gender violence,"This afternoon, the Polytechnic University of Cartagena gave a reading, carried out by the manager, Isidro Ibarra, of the manifesto prepared by the Network of Gender Equality Units for University Excellence on the occasion of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. Below is the full text: «For several decades, 25N, International Day for the Eradication of Violence against Women, has been an exceptional moment to vindicate, demand and remind people with responsibilities and the entire society in general that , as long as patriarchal violence persists, we will not be able to achieve just, egalitarian societies that respect human rights. The prevalence of violence is increasingly worrying, as reflected in the recent European Gender Violence Survey (EEVG) with data from 2022, which indicates extremely alarming figures for the prevalence of patriarchal violence, although it also draws a positive context in relationship with the greater knowledge and recognition of this violence by younger women. Although in educational institutions in general, and in universities in particular, much progress has been made in equality between women and men, situations that violate students, researchers and professors, and workers in the administration field still persist. and services. In this sense, the contributions of the “UNISAFE European Project, to end gender violence in the Academy” are relevant, as it concludes that the main reason why sexist aggression is not reported in the university context is because, on many occasions, , the victim doubts the seriousness of what was suffered, doubts if she will be believed, doubts if there will be an answer for what she experienced. It is important not to normalize or naturalize the violence suffered, it is important that also in universities we move towards making visible each and every one of the sexist violence that is exercised within them. Universities, as higher education institutions, must contribute to addressing this situation by providing scientific evidence, training future generations of professionals with a gender perspective, developing useful and effective resources for the entire society and participating both individually and collectively in the culture of equality that identifies, makes visible, denounces and isolates sexist behaviors and attitudes. In addition to the continuity of traditional sexist violence, new modes of misogyny are emerging, such as the gendertrolling of “digital mobs” in the online universe. In this context, new political actors stand out, such as the “manosphere”, encouraged by transnational movements that promote misogynistic and anti-feminist attitudes and perspectives. Their influence on the formation of opinions and the spread of extremist political ideas is shaping imaginaries and behaviors from an early age. A clear example of this is the so-called “Almendralejo case”, which revealed the digital sexist violence exercised by a group of underage boys on more than twenty girls and adolescents, whose image was used to create pornography using artificial intelligence. The media reach of this case has served to make society aware of the seriousness of the problem of misuse of technological advances, but it is not an isolated case, since humiliating expressions against women in the digital world are constantly reproduced. For yet another year, it is still necessary to denounce that gender violence is a violation of human rights in which universities, as part of society, have the responsibility to actively get involved. Therefore, this month it is also important to show our solidarity with girls and women around the world who are suffering restrictions on their rights to be free and equal. Today, in Palestine, Ukraine, Iran, Afghanistan and many other places in the world. On this occasion, we appeal to feminist genealogy, its history, the production of academic knowledge with a gender perspective, the strength of young women and the human dimension of society, to weave, more than ever, worlds of hope feminist, another possible world, free of violence against women and girls, because the progress and social and institutional commitment is increasing in the face of all patriarchal violence in the university space and in society, in general. Today, and every day of the year, we claim feminism as a tool of emancipation to achieve a society in which we can be and be. Following the invaluable example of the world soccer champions of our national team, we join their cry: #It's over.",5,40

German university hires UPCT researchers to design an IoT network with 5G technology,"The Ostfalia Polytechnic, with campuses in several cities in northern Germany, has selected the UPCT Telematics Engineering research group for the design and development of a communications protocol to enable 5G (fifth Generation) technology in a decentralized network of connected devices. The project, put out to tender for 100,000 euros in a competitive process in which companies and researchers from different countries have participated, has an execution period of a year and a half. The German university valued the twenty years of experience in the development of communication protocols and their application for the so-called Internet of Things (IoT) of the researchers from the Polytechnic of Cartagena, who have patents and other intellectual property records in this field. “In current IoT networks, only telemetry is transmitted, with the data collected by the different sensors. Using 5G telecommunications technologies, large amounts of data flows, including video and audio, can be transmitted between the devices themselves, in a decentralized manner,” explain researchers Joan García, Antonio Javier García, Rafael Asorey and Laura García. “It will be a disruptive technology, which will open large market niches in robotics, Industry 5.0, defense and emergency management, because it will enable communications without the need for centralized infrastructures such as telephone antennas,” they exemplify. “The devices themselves will be the data routers, receiving and emitting,” add these teachers from the UPCT School of Telecommunications. The incorporation of 5G technology into IoT networks also seeks to achieve ultra-low latencies, with performance similar to analog devices, which opens the door to its application in the audiovisual field. “In the project we will incorporate the transmission of audio data between network devices,” advance the researchers from the Polytechnic University of Cartagena.",14,77

María Salinas obtains her university degree at UPCT 69 years after finishing her studies,"María Salinas Sánchez (Cartagena, 1937) has received her university degree today at the Polytechnic University of Cartagena, almost 70 years after completing her studies as a Commercial Expert. María could not hold office because she had not carried out the Social Service of the Women's Section, which at that time was a 'national duty' for women. “It was another time. It was another life,” says this octogenarian, who began her university studies at the old Cartagena Business School. María went to Carmelitas school in Cartagena. The nuns told his father that he had the aptitude to go to university. He really liked Calculus, Mathematics and Accounting and chose to study Commercial Expertise. He keeps his 'school book', so it is possible to see a record in which, for example, in the second year he got an A in five of the six subjects of the course. María finished her studies, like her husband. But he did title. She was forced to start Social Service in order to achieve it. ""I went to those mandatory classes in the Women's Section for several days but I couldn't resist the history that was there, that kind of indoctrination."" The UPCT has carried out the process with the Ministry of Education and Vocational Training so that María can obtain the title. The processing has lasted nine months. His degree is issued with a current date although it appears that he completed it on June 9, 1954. “It all begins thanks to one of his daughters and Professor Juan Patricio Castro, who manages to find the academic record to carry out the procedure with the Ministry with which “We have been able to issue the title,” explained the rector, Beatriz Miguel. ""It was clear that he had passed all the subjects and what he was missing is something that belongs to the past and that is not necessary for tenure,"" he added, indicating that it is ""a fair rectification."" The Rector has invited other people in these circumstances to request the University to process their university degree and has pointed out that María Salinas' is an example of ""the conditions that women have today, we did not always have them, access to University and tenure was not so easy.” María has been surrounded by her family.

Will our students stop being students at some point?,"This Friday is celebrated in much of the world as International Students' Day. This commemoration has its origins in 1939, when on October 28 of that same year Jan Opletal, a 24-year-old medical student at Charles University in Prague, was murdered due to the Nazi invasion that occurred in the former Czechoslovakia. In memory of the students who stood up to fascism, the International Student Council, established in London in 1941 and which later became the International Union of Students (UIE), declared that date as International Student Day. More than 5,000 students study at UPCT. The most likely thing is that when they finish their degree or master's degree they will have to continue training. Will they ever stop being students? The current context shows that it is necessary to update, recycle and commit to continuous training. For this reason, more and more people are joining the 'upskilling' and 'reskilling' bandwagon. 'Upskilling' allows a worker to perfect or acquire new skills or abilities within the same profile to optimize their performance. 'Reskilling', also known as professional recycling, allows this evolution but seeks to train an employee to adapt them to a new position in the company. Of the 5,461 students of official UPCT degrees, 4,522 are enrolled in undergraduate studies, 675 in master's degrees and 264 in doctoral programs. In addition to them, 1,176 students with their own degrees, oriented towards continuous training, were trained in UPCT classrooms last year, according to data provided by the Office of Prospecting and Data Analysis (OPADA).",1,125
"José Luis Vicens, oldest student at UPCT: ""Learning has to be rewarding""","He was born in 1949 in Linares. He is the oldest student at UPCT. When you 'google' his name, José Luis Vicens Moltó, he appears on Linkedin as a 'student'. When looking at the section on his training, you can read a list of university studies since 1970: doctor, orthopedic surgeon and specialty traumatologist, agricultural engineer and master's degree in Environmental Engineering and Sustainable Processes, in Advanced Research Techniques in Agricultural and Food Development and in Renewable energy. He is currently a doctoral student in the Industrial Technologies program. Faculty consulted highlight that when he completed his degree at the School of Agricultural Engineering “he motivated the rest of the students.” It was between 2004 and 2007. They claim that his attitude benefited his entire promotion. “He is a person who studies because he wants to, because he likes it,” they explain. He began that new university career at the age of 58. His efforts earned him the Extraordinary End of Year Award and the Agustín Diéguez from the Industrial School. And he also got involved, to the point that he was a course delegate and of the School of Agronomists. “My Agronomists classmate received me very well, much better than we would have received when I studied Medicine,” he says with satisfaction. “I was surprised to be treated like one of the others from the beginning,” he recalls. “We had a good time, even though there were tough exams. I also get overwhelmed and suffer from stress like the rest of the students. I also had failures. Everything happened to me,” he concludes. “Mental effort and exercise has its limits, like the physical one. It has to be rewarding, if it is exhausting it is not worth it,” he argues. Now seventy years old, he has chosen to study for a doctorate, to avoid the memorizing efforts that exams require. His thesis, directed by Blas Zamora, deals with learning Engineering, based on his own experience. He has also taught, as a teacher of Matlab courses organized by SAIT, having up to 300 students. “I have wanted to give back to the system everything it has given me,” he comments. Navy doctor in Madrid, Cádiz and Cartagena, he retired with the position of commander. And since then he has dedicated himself to increasing his university education. ""We have to do something. I wasn't old enough when I retired to dedicate myself to the stretcher table,"" he explains. “I had a very active, almost frenetic professional life, and suddenly it all ended. I needed to occupy myself with something,” he adds.",9,74
"Nanoparticles, bacteria and geomembranes to reduce ammonia emissions in slurry ponds by up to 90%","The Chair of Environmental Management for the Sustainability of Intensive Pig Farming has presented in Fuente Álamo, before ranchers, businessmen in the pork sector and technicians from the City Council and the Department of Water, Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries, the main findings of the 'Evaluation' project. of Different Techniques for the Reduction of Greenhouse Gas and Ammonia Emissions in Purine Storage Ponds', carried out by the UPCT research group on Management, Use and Recovery of Soil and Water. In the project, different manure management techniques have been applied in storage ponds with the aim of mitigating the emissions generated in its handling, to obtain a transformed livestock by-product with optimal conditions for its valorization. Initially, emissions have been studied in ten low-capacity storage ponds for slurry from fattening pigs. The techniques used include the application of different types of bacteria, physical treatments (separation), chemical treatments (acidification), installation of devices with nanoparticles that accelerate the bioremediation of slurry, aerobic digestion, and the use of different types of coverage such as straw or geomembrane. textile. “In this way, in most of the applied techniques, percentages of efficiency in reducing ammonia emissions greater than 40% and up to 90% have been achieved,” details the director of the chair and the research group, Ángel Faz Cano. . “In all storage systems, the reduction of emissions depends on the technique applied and whether it is under adequate environmental conditions that allow changes in the properties of the slurry to occur through physical, chemical and biological processes. The proper implementation and application of the techniques used helps to mitigate the emissions of the pork sector into the atmosphere, helping to comply with the commitments to reduce emissions of ammonia and nitrogen oxides contemplated in the European directive 2016/2284 and in the Royal Decree 818/2018, while facilitating the sustainable agronomic management and valorization of this by-product,” adds the professor from the Polytechnic University of Cartagena.",6,102

High-resolution geophysical techniques to optimize water savings in trees in the Region,"High-resolution electrical tomography, both in two and three dimensions, to detect changes in humidity and salinity up to three meters deep in the soil and thus optimize irrigation water consumption. This is what researchers from the UPCT School of Roads and Mines are doing, in a project led by the CEBAS (Center for Soil Science and Applied Biology of Segura). The trials are carried out in garrofero crops, located in Fuente Álamo. The researchers, from the Somera Applied Geophysics group, will incorporate a georadar in the coming weeks to measure the distribution of tree roots and thus specify the irrigation areas and whether there is a difference between the different established irrigation treatments. This is a novel technology in measuring humidity in these crops, say researchers Pedro Martínez Pagán and Marcos Martínez Segura. The CICLICA Research and Innovation project uses advanced water-saving technologies and unconventional water resources. Researchers are implementing biotechnology and agrosolutions for irrigation-fertigation modeling, to improve agronomic management and genetic adaptation of traditional crops such as carob and jojoba. These works by CEBAS, a research center belonging to the State Agency for Higher Scientific Research Council (CSIC), allow us to know, in addition to humidity and salinity, the texture, roots and root distribution, among other agronomic parameters of interest. The data obtained will be studied to. The data obtained will be used to implement alternative crops by applying sustainable agricultural practices, which contribute to the maintenance of ecosystems, strengthen the capacity to adapt to climate change, extreme weather events, or continuous erosion and droughts, cooperating in the conservation of soils and optimizing productive resources, especially scarce water resources.

The Euclid mission uses technology developed at UPCT to see galaxies 10 billion light years away,"The sharpest astronomical images of such a vast and distant region of the Universe, located up to 10 billion light years from Earth. The European Space Agency's (ESA) Euclid space mission, launched on July 1 with a telescope on board using technology developed at UPCT, has revealed five full-color images demonstrating that the telescope is ready to create the world's largest 3D map. extensive universe to date. The Polytechnic University of Cartagena (UPCT) and the Institute of Astrophysics of the Canary Islands (IAC) were in charge of the electronic unit that controls the infrared instrument and its startup software, while the other part of the Spanish contribution to the telescope's payload was carried out by the Institute of Space Sciences (ICE-CSIC), the Institute of High Energy Physics (IFAE), the Institute of Space Studies of Catalonia (IEEC) and the Scientific Information Port (PIC), responsible for the design, construction, assembly and validation test of the filter wheel of the infrared instrument, as well as the cosmological simulations of the mission. In addition, UPCT researchers collaborate with around a hundred international scientists to unravel the mysteries of the dark universe from the images captured by Euclid. The mission aims to investigate dark matter and dark energy, which make up 95% of the cosmos. The nature of these has not yet been discovered, since their presence causes subtle changes in the appearance and movements of the observable universe. To reveal the influence of dark matter and energy in the visible universe, over the next six years Euclid will observe the shapes, distances and motions of billions of galaxies within a radius of up to 10 billion light years. Thus, it will create the largest three-dimensional map of the universe so far. Euclid's recording of the cosmos is exceptional for its ability to create a remarkably sharp visible and infrared image over a large region of the sky at once. “It is amazing to realize that something you have built is very far away in space and is capable of revealing the universe in such detail. We look forward to the scientific discoveries that are coming,” says researcher Francisco Castander, from the ICE-CSIC and the IEEC. For their part, the researchers responsible for the contribution of the UPCT in Euclid in engineering, Rafael Toledo, and science, Anastasio Díaz Sánchez and Antonio Pérez Garrido, highlight “the enormous satisfaction of seeing how technology and science developed in the “Spanish universities occupy such a prominent place in a historical mission like Euclid.” “I wish to congratulate and thank everyone involved in making this ambitious mission a reality, which is a reflection of European excellence and international collaboration. The first images captured by Euclid are impressive and remind us why it is essential that we go to space to learn more about the mysteries of the universe,” says ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher.

Waste-based and viable cements to replace clinker and reduce CO2 generated by construction,"Five different cements, made from local waste and raw materials, with a low carbon footprint and whose extraction produces zero or almost zero impact on the environment, have been tested on an industrial scale by Víctor Martínez Pacheco in his thesis to demonstrate the “viability to immediately reduce clinker consumption in the cement industry.” “The cements obtained are compatible with all uses of traditional cement,” maintains the author of this industrial doctoral research, developed at Cementos La Cruz and in the laboratories of the Polytechnic University of Cartagena (UPCT) and the Eduardo Torroja Institute of the Center Higher School of Scientific Research (CSIC). Traditional cement has clinker as its main component, a synthetic material that requires very high firing temperatures, which is why its manufacturing generates enormous carbon dioxide emissions and makes cement currently responsible for 10% of the CO2 emitted. in the planet. The thesis has also sought regulatory fits for the early adoption of these 'ecological cements' in the construction sector. This commitment to sustainability includes the adaptation of these new materials to concrete 3D printing processes, also incorporating digital transformation in this industry. “3D printing can be the key to reducing the carbon footprint of our buildings by 90%, in addition to the advantages of precision, robotization, work quality, optimization and design of very highly complex shapes that it allows,” argues Martínez Pacheco. The research on additive manufacturing applications with the new cements has been carried out in the Cementos La Cruz 3DLAB Additive Manufacturing Laboratory building, built expressly for this research with clinker-free cement and equipped with a large format concrete printer, with which they have been able to explore the limits in reducing the carbon footprint and develop new construction systems that “will change the way we understand the construction industry,” adds the architect and already a doctor from the UPCT. The thesis 'Development of low carbon footprint cementitious materials for applications in the construction industry and adaptation for additive manufacturing in low environmental impact architecture', carried out under the industrial doctorate modality, has been directed by Carlos Parra, Ángel Palomo and Pilar Hidalgo.",9,77

Biometric registration or single-use QR to access the Antigones study classrooms on weekends,"The domotic access control system in the buildings of the Polytechnic University of Cartagena is being expanded from this weekend to the study classrooms of Antigones. Students who wish to enter the School of Telecommunications outside of school hours may do so using the UPCT 'app' or through biometric identification. Students can register their biometric data at the School of Telecommunications itself or can choose to use single-use QR codes generated through the UPCT mobile application. The turnstiles equipped with a QR reader and facial recognition camera have been used since the beginning of this course at ELDI, where they are already used by UPCT staff and students who carry out teaching practices or research tasks there. External users must register to use the system. The biometric identification system was experimentally implemented in the R&D&I building in 2021, thus validating all the equipment that was acquired using the state COVID-19 Fund. This system uses a facial biometric identification procedure that requires the prior capture of users' biometric data. The captured data generates a geometric pattern unique to each user and invalid to reconstruct their facial image. “Knowing the identity of those who access our facilities increases security among the university community and allows us to know the flows and occupancy rates, useful for programming a more efficient use of the buildings' equipment and services,” explains the vice-rector of Campus and Sustainability, Juan Pedro Solano, remembering that the system will not be used to control the working day and that it complies with the requirements set by the Organic Law on Data Protection.

Community and public universities begin work to define the financing model until 2028,"The regional government and the public universities of the Region have begun work to define the future Multiannual Financing Plan, which will cover the period 2024-2028, and which must guarantee financial sufficiency and consolidate academic activity of excellence. The Minister of the Environment, Universities, Research and Mar Menor, Juan María Vázquez, held the first meeting today with the rector of the University of Murcia, José Luján, and the rector of the Polytechnic University of Cartagena, Beatriz Miguel, together with their respective teams, to discuss the general principles that will mark the financing model of public academic institutions. ""It is in everyone's spirit that this plan see the light in the shortest term to be able to advance our public universities,"" highlighted the rector of the UPCT at the end of the meeting. Vázquez pointed out that this is a “priority axis of the regional government” to support the university system, which “is one of the main elements on which the development, prosperity and growth of a region revolves.” The counselor stated that ""the uncontrolled inflation and the historic rise in the prices of energy and raw materials have also had an impact on the universities, to which the regional government has responded with a historic increase in their budgets."" Added to these circumstances are the commitments of the new Organic Law of the University System. For all these reasons, ""it is necessary to address the development of this financing instrument, which will allow the public universities of the Region to plan their strategies and policies in the medium term, which they currently cannot do on an annual basis."" Juan María Vázquez stressed that ""we are going to create the new model with the universities and by consensus with all the representatives of the university community."" Keys to the 2024-2028 financing model The head of Universities transferred to the rectors the first working document of the new financing model 2024-2028, reviewable every five years, which will determine the way in which the amount allocated by the Community in its budgets and the multi-year projection rules will be distributed between the two academic institutions. It will be based on two fundamental components. One will be the financing that ensures the salaries of professors, researchers or technical, management, administration and services personnel, salary increases of any nature and current expenses that allow the basic functioning of the university to be achieved, including the particularities of the infrastructures of the universities. The second, financing for objectives that promote excellence and academic and research competitiveness at the proposal of both the universities and the Autonomous Community and that seek, from the uniqueness of each university, the best possible results, both academic and research. The achievement of the proposed objectives will be linked to obtaining these additional funds. 232 million in 2023 The counselor recalled the “firm and permanent support” of the regional government for the universities and stressed that “this year the Community is making a great effort by allocating 232 million euros to public universities only for basic financing, which It represents a historic increase of 13.5 percent compared to the previous year and which means being above the national average.” This percentage increase translates into 27.7 million euros more than in 2022, which represents “a great effort, especially taking into account that the Region of Murcia is the worst financed autonomous community in the country,” he insisted.",2,98

"José Carlos Díez: ""Those who do not enter Artificial Intelligence will do worse""","""The key will be education and universities will have to make a great effort to continuously train workers for the new jobs that are emerging,"" underlines the well-known economist José Carlos Díez, who this Friday gave the conference 'Artificial intelligence, productivity and the future of employment' at the Faculty of Business Sciences of the Polytechnic of Cartagena. - What impact is Artificial Intelligence (AI) going to have on productivity? - AI represents a revolution and for economists it is a challenge to calculate the value it provides because many of its services are free and do not count for our national accounting system from the 1950s. But we are already seeing that it increases productivity and employment in countries and companies that are applying artificial intelligence. - What jobs are in danger? - It will especially affect low-skilled personnel and those from emerging countries, so we need to design public policies to reduce the costs of this technological transition and make aid to the unemployed more effective. The key will be education and universities will have to make a great effort to continuously train workers for the new jobs that are emerging. - Doesn't this technological revolution also threaten qualified jobs? - There will be widespread changes, but qualified people will be able to adapt better. In any case, those who do not enter AI will have worse jobs and salaries. It will be worse for him. - Will it also affect economists and business experts? Will economic forecasts made by artificial intelligence be reliable? - AI will make automatic processes, but what is valuable is not the data that everyone has, but the qualitative interpretation of the forecasts. We economists will have to be strategists and leave the hours of calculation to the machine. - Will AI reproduce the biases of its creators? - AI engines are not biased, but the data they use is. I am developing my own chatbot to respond to visitors to my blog and I am training it to consult the information that I consider of value, not just any data. - How much do you have to know about technology to use AI? - You have to understand the language that machines speak to know what questions to ask them and get the most out of them. But it's like to drive a Formula 1, you don't need to be an engineer. José Carlos Díez already gave a conference at the Faculty of Business Sciences in 2018, in which he highlighted that “Cartagena must diversify its economy more and base it on new technologies, which are essential for growth. To do this, you have to rely on the UPCT.”",10,109

The ""reimagination of buildings"", as the ideation process is called, will be carried out by a multidisciplinary team with the active participation of users and neighbors. The ideas and new defined uses will be incorporated into the specifications of the competition of ideas that the town councils organize for the drafting of the renovation project. The renovation projects will be an opportunity to involve users and make them more aware of the community in which they live, in a space for all those related to the activities to be carried out in each building. Likewise, the restoration of the outdoor spaces of these neighborhoods will be carried out, with the aim of improving the public use of these areas and providing spaces for local communities to meet. The design of these actions will also be carried out collaboratively with neighbors, based on the reuse and recycling of existing materials to minimize the use of new resources. All actions in buildings and public spaces will be accompanied by an intense monitoring program of environmental and social indicators to measure the impact of the project. A holistic analysis will also be carried out on the integration of sustainability, beauty and inclusion aspects, to validate the application of the NEB approach. 'Beautiful, sustainable, together: validation of the New European Bauhaus approach for the reimagination of public buildings as boosting projects for the transformation of their neighborhoods' is the full name of the LIFE_BauhausingEurope project (LIFE22-ENV-ES-LIFEBauhausingEurope).",9,100
They test a new sensor with Artificial Intelligence to detect people during Science Week,"Researchers from the UPCT Systems and Electronic Engineering Division Group will test a new sensor with Artificial Intelligence (AI) for detection during Science and Technology Week (SeCyT), which is being held this weekend in Murcia. and tracking people. The developed device will be used to measure the number of people in public spaces. The tests will be carried out on a model of a bus with AI sensors installed in one of the UPCT stands on El Malecón, where the SeCyT is held. When passing under the sensor, the device will detect the person and follow their exit. Numerous units of this device are being installed at the Moncloa transport interchange in Madrid and on the Alsa company buses that arrive to this place in the capital to detect the flow of citizens, says the researcher responsible at the UPCT, Pedro. J. Navarro. Moncloa is the oldest interchange in Madrid and the most used currently. It is a ""new generation"" interchange and the one that manages the most travelers in the Community of Madrid, with 32 million a year and an average of 124,000 people every day. The possibility of knowing in real time the occupancy of the buses in which it is installed will make it easier to adjust the supply of public transport to real demand. This translates into a considerable reduction in the carbon footprint and optimization of travel by public transport. Navarro points out that smart mobility allows public transport to be dynamically adapted to the needs of the cities of the future. It is useful to adapt city traffic to real needs. This project, titled 'Metropolis. Mobility in the city of the future' (PLEC2021-007609), is financed by the Ministry of Science and Innovation with European Next Generation funds and is developed by researchers from UP4, the alliance of the country's four polytechnic universities.

Professor Mascaraque analyzes the new theories of the sinking of the Kursk nuclear submarine,"23 years have passed since the sinking of the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk, in which the crew and companions died. New theories suggest that the accident could have been due to a collision with a NATO submarine. Is this a possible theory? How could this tragedy occur? The deputy director of the UPCT School of Naval and Oceanic Engineering, Carlos Mascaraque, states in an interview broadcast on the national program 'La Noche de Adolfo Arjona', that this theory “may be feasible with the explanation but it can never be proven.” . The latter theory holds that the Kurs did not sink in the collision. He says there were two American submarines spying on the maneuvers and one of them collided with the Kurs and another launched a torpedo. This would support the two collisions in the official report. Mascaraque, during his interview on the Cope network, also refers to the maintenance of the submarine, which was only six years old. He also mentions the few hours of training of the crew, the lack of experience to operate this type of torpedoes as a possible cause. The Soviet Army submersible was launched in 1994. It measured 154 meters in length. Its length exceeded that of two Boeing 747 airplanes. It was four stories high and was considered an unsinkable submarine. Shipwrecked in northern Russia. 118 people died. Reports say that 16 hours passed before the Kursk could be located. A subsequent official investigation concluded that a faulty weld in the shell casing caused the explosion that destroyed the torpedo room.",14,17

They demonstrate the validity of a quantum method to measure molecules with greater precision,"“A quantum leap in precision measurements to discover the secrets of molecules,” is how UPCT researcher Santiago Oviedo Casado defines the advance represented by the application of quantum physics technologies in the study of samples at the molecular level. A quantum detection protocol whose validity and convenience have been theoretically and empirically verified by a group of researchers led by the researcher from the Polytechnic of Cartagena and who has just published the prestigious Physical Review Letters, a journal in the first decile of relevance among those dedicated to Physical. “Quantum properties of matter can be used broadly to increase precision and overcome noise-induced haze in a wide range of measurements, including oscillations of the nuclei of molecules, traditionally detected using nuclear magnetic resonance,” explains the researcher from the UPCT Quantum Technologies group. “In the article we demonstrate the ability of the Qdyne protocol to access the information hidden in tiny samples of molecules,” he adds, recalling that these measurements offer essential knowledge about physics, medicine and biology. “Due to its multiparametric sensitivity without noise limitations to the quantum properties of the probe, this protocol and the use of Bayesian analysis is the most effective way to obtain experimental data in a highly noisy environment. “We demonstrate our theory by carrying out experiments in which we detect the oscillations of nuclei in molecules with unprecedented precision, and under environmental conditions,” highlights the UPCT researcher, highlighting this milestone as a “crucial step towards solving critical problems such as “the detection of different chemical species or molecular couplings in samples of biochemical relevance.” Research funding sources: Postdoctoral scholarship from the Ramón Areces Foundation and María Zambrano scholarship.

They develop an evacuation system that indicates safe escape routes in real time,"“Saving lives is the ultimate goal of this research,” explains the new doctor from the Polytechnic of Cartagena Heitor Martínez Grueira, who has developed in his thesis a Dynamic Evacuation Monitoring System (SIMONE) that indicates in real time the optimal routes for the evacuation of ships or buildings, using automatic lighting devices. The development is “especially interesting for passenger ships, whose users are not properly trained in evacuation plans or protocols, and also for buildings, making it possible to guide occupants in real time through safe escape routes in case of fires or other incidents,” explains the author of the thesis. The system adapts to the type of incident, whether it is a leak in a ship or a fire in a building, and calculates the fastest and safest routes so that all occupants can reach safety in the shortest possible time. “This software prototype for evacuation management could be adapted to any compartmentalized infrastructure,” adds the researcher who, as a lieutenant captain in the Army Corps of Engineers, was able to validate it on the structure of a military ship. “Those who are instructed and trained in evacuation processes know how to move quickly on a ship in the event of a shipwreck, but passengers on commercial ships do not have the necessary training,” he exemplifies. The new doctor has also completed the master's degree in Decision Support Techniques taught by the San Javier University Defense Center, attached to the UPCT. “Doing the thesis has been an educational challenge,” he declares. His doctoral research has been directed by Rafael Asorey Cacheda and Luis Francisco Sánchez Álvarez and includes a quote from the Oral Torah that summarizes the project's motto: “He who saves a life is as if he saved the entire Universe.”",9,100

"The Life TRIPLET project, coordinated by the UPCT, begins to optimize irrigation","The Life TRIPLET project, coordinated by UPCT researcher Alejandro Pérez Pastor, held its kickoff meeting this month in Madrid. The main objective of the project is to increase the sustainability of irrigated agriculture through the digitalization of fertigation. This project aims to implement in the majority of the most representative crops in the Mediterranean a digital platform resulting from the adaptation of four other existing ones provided by four project partners: UPTC, IMIDA, Aquatec and FMC. The four combined tools will provide information on irrigation water optimization, soil-plant-atmosphere water indicators at the demonstration plot level, and crop effects of herbicides and diseases. The project will carry out trials on demonstration plots in the irrigation communities of Campo de Cartagena, Totana, Pliego, Pulpí (Almería), the Vicario reservoir (Ciudad Real), Mancha Occidental II (Albacete, Ciudad Real, Cuenca and Toledo) and Acequia Real de Júcar (Valencia). On the other hand, the information on the indices of each demonstration plot can be visualized, a predictive model will be applied using machine learning techniques, and all irrigation and fertigation variables will be integrated into a powerful database. Other project partners are Agbar, Cetaqua, Azud, the Community of Users of the Mancha Occidental II Groundwater Mass (CUAS II) and FENACORE. The full name of the Life TRIPLET project is 'Digitalisation of efficient fertigation management for a sustainable agriculture' and its code is 101113915 LIFE2022 CCA ES LIFE TRIPLET.

Business Administration student anticipates advantages as a means of payment and risks for digital euro banking,"It will be a reality in a few years, if the European Central Bank so decides, and a final project for the bilingual degree in Business Administration and Management at the UPCT has already analyzed the reasons that recommend creating the digital euro and doing so with precautions to avoid a financial crisis. “The digital euro would offer a means of electronic payment that anyone could use in the euro zone,” explains the ECB itself. It would be easy to use, through cards or mobile applications. The difference with the euros with which we already pay digitally is that it would be money issued directly by the Central Bank. “It would be extremely safe, as depositors we would be completely covered,” explains the director of the TFG, Víctor López Pérez. The virtual currency would have the same value as the physical euro and could be used without having a bank account or debit or credit card. “Transfers outside the EU would be cheaper and faster,” adds the teacher, an especially relevant advantage in an era of global trade. Limits and no anonymity Unlike cash and cryptocurrencies, using the digital euro there would be no anonymity, although the Central Bank works to ensure the privacy of what we pay with the virtual currency. Yes, it will be controlled how many digital euros each citizen has and it has already been proposed to establish limits, around 3,000 euros, to avoid hoarding and restrict its use to everyday payments. “The digital euro must be attractive, but not so attractive that the deposits of private banks are emptied,” warns the TFG, written and presented in English, by Jaime McGreevy Staczek, which anticipates financial problems if the bank loses its principal. financing route. With the digital yuan and the digital dollar in the testing phase in China and the United States, and with the progressive investment in cryptocurrencies by the younger population, “the European Union cannot be left behind and must live up to other currencies, since we Europeans could also use these other virtual currencies and we would lose our monetary sovereignty,” warns the student. “Doubts about the privacy of payments have focused the debate on the digital euro, but at the same time the absence of anonymity would be an advantage to reduce the underground economy,” explains the graduate of the Faculty of Business Sciences of the UPCT. Faced with the volatility of the value of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which precisely for this reason capture the interest of those who invest in the short term, the digital euro would not generate these speculative movements and “it would comply with the characteristic of a reliable store of value that we ask of the money,” concludes the professor from the Department of Economics, Accounting and Finance.",14,102

"Alarm rooster, flock without a shepherd and digital doors to the countryside, the UPCT rewards the rural digitalization projects of the IES Ricardo Ortega","Three technological innovation ideas for rural areas represented the Region of Murcia in the second edition of the Digitize your town contest, which ended this summer. The School of Telecommunications of the UPCT, one of the four participating universities, has today recognized the work of the students of the IES Ricardo Ortega de Fuente Álamo who presented their projects in the national final and that of the students of the Polytechnic of Cartagena who tutored as mentors. The projects provide technical solutions, based on electronic programming and software development, to rural problems such as insecurity, lack of shepherds or the disconnection of the rhythms of daily life with natural cycles. To reconnect with the natural clock, a group of students has designed the 'Solar Rooster' application, which would reproduce rooster sounds captured daily on users' mobile phones, with an individualizable delay time with respect to the time when the roosters crowed. animals. Faced with the lack of manpower for herding tasks, another team of students has devised the 'Flock without a shepherd' application to remotely send sounds to guide the sheep herd and the shepherd dog, which would have a geolocator on its collar to locate the flock at all times. And to prevent theft and improper access to agricultural or livestock production, a third group has proposed the 'Digital Doors to the Field' system with ultrasonic and motion sensors connected to alarms that would notify the owners and scare away animals or unauthorized people that access the controlled areas. ""It is a brutal satisfaction to see these technological proposals to solve rural problems,"" highlighted the director of the School of Telecommunications, Alejandro Álvarez, recalling that in his family's town in León there was no running water, telephone or television signal when he was child.

Latin American experiences recommend the use of geothermal energy in the Region to save on air conditioning,"The Somera Ibero-American Geothermal Network meets for the first time in Spain, starting today at the Polytechnic University of Cartagena, to share the advantages of using the temperature disparity between the surface and the subsoil to air-condition all types of constructions both in cold and cold climates. warm. “The key is extreme temperatures. Geothermal energy has generally been used in very cold countries to heat buildings, but in Mexico we are using it to cool and save up to 50% on air conditioning,” explained energy expert from the National Autonomous University of Mexico David Morillon Gálvez, who He has given a conference on bioclimatic architecture. “Geothermal energy is a sustainable alternative when the use of environmental conditions, such as solar radiation or wind, is not enough to achieve comfort temperatures for homes, buildings, industries or farms,” emphasizes the Mexican engineer, who is participating in projects that use geothermal energy in the desert north of their country, with the Canadian well technique, of shallow depth, and through the so-called energy piles using the foundation piles that are required in buildings in Mexico City. “Taking advantage of drilling work during construction makes the installation of geothermal heat pumps cheaper,” he points out. The Region of Murcia has sufficient geothermal capacity to supply the residential demand for air conditioning, according to the thesis at the UPCT of Adela Ramos, who mapped the potential of this renewable resource that uses the subsoil and its stable temperatures to, through heat exchangers, air conditioning buildings. ""It is a renewable and ubiquitous source available to everyone, which uses the subsoil as an energy sink,"" explains the coordinator of the Ibero-American Geothermal Network Somera, Mar Alcaraz, researcher in the Department of Mining and Civil Engineering of the UPCT.

Bigger lettuce and spinach with fewer pathogens thanks to agricultural and coffee waste compost,"The thesis of the new doctor from the Polytechnic University of Cartagena Alicia Hernández Lara supports the use of agroindustrial compost for the biological control of diseases in lettuce and spinach crops. This circular and sustainable economy technique provides agronomic and soil improvements, by improving crop yields and microbial and fungal activity in the soil. “Agricultural waste and additives incorporated during the composting process improve compost as a growing medium and as an organic amendment in solarization processes for soil disinfection,” explains the CEBAS-CSIC researcher. The tests were carried out by combining tomato waste, leek, olive oil mill residue and pruning remains and incorporating different additives such as coffee waste, thyme, lavender and rockrose during the composting process. “The lettuce plants grown in compost showed significantly higher fresh weight values than those grown in peat, with the composts with coffee showing a higher yield,” highlights the thesis. The research also highlights that tomato and leek residues added with lavender had the greatest capacity to eliminate plant pathogens such as 'Pythium irregulare', known as water mold and which rots plants. “This compost can be used as a partial substitute for peat in greenhouse lettuce cultivation,” recommends the researcher. “The goal is to improve soil fertility, maintaining a safe environment by reducing the application of pesticides and chemical fertilizers,” he adds. “The combination of compost and solarization process for soil disinfection practice increased total organic carbon, total nitrogen and microbial activity. The compost produced significant changes in the bacterial and fungal communities of the soil, which were maintained after the harvest,"" also concludes the thesis, directed by Margarita Ros Muñoz and José Antonio Pascual Valero, under the supervision of UPCT professor Catalina Egea.

The most viewed news in August,"The Communication Service continued to be active in August, publishing around twenty news items. The following have been the ones that have registered the most visits on our website: 1st The sludge extraction system patented by a UPCT graduate is being tested in the Albufera de Valencia The Comprehensive Suction System for Water Materials (SISMA) patented by the graduate in Industrial Technologies from the UPCT Antonio Martínez Segado and his partner Justo González has just been put into practice in the Albufera of Valencia, managing to extract half a ton of sludge per hour. The extracted sludge has been supplied to cement and concrete production companies to study whether its reuse as a component of construction materials is viable. “We have already verified its usefulness as fertilizer and fertilizer in the Campo de Cartagena,” recalls the UPCT former student, who last year carried out a test of his patent on a beach in Los Alcázares and who has been contacted by the companies that are going to carry out for the Cartagena City Council the environmental impact study of the extraction of sludge from Estrella de Mar beach, south of the Mar Menor. Another piece of news related to the environmental state of the salt lagoon was the discovery on the beaches of the Mar Menor and in its sea bream of microplastics used in agriculture and nautical vessels. 2nd Three scholarship holders from its chair at the Polytechnic of Cartagena hired by Estrella de Levante The Estrella de Levante brewery has hired three scholarship holders from its chair at the Polytechnic University of Cartagena to continue the R&D&I projects that they started in efficiency energy, data mining and barley and hop cultivation strategies in various areas of the Region of Murcia. The three recently hired graduates have been trained in the UPCT schools of Industrial Engineering, Telecommunications Engineering and Agricultural Engineering. “It is an example of the diversity of projects we develop,” explains the head of the Estrella Levante chair at the Polytechnic, Ángel Molina. Currently the chair has two other scholarship holders from the UPCT School of Industrialists who are developing R&D&I tasks in the environmental field. Another piece of news about students hired after doing internships published in August was that of Ana Sánchez, who continues, now as an employee, in the Turia minehunter repair project at the Navantia shipyard. 3rd A doctoral thesis quantifies more than 3,300 concessions in the Sierra Minera in 120 years of activity More than 3,329 mining concessions in the Sierra Minera de Cartagena-La Unión in 120 years. It is the figure that appears in the doctoral thesis of Manuel Rosique Campoy, defended at the UPCT, on the historical evolution of this business activity, developed between 1841 and 1961. The work includes a cartographic reconstruction and data of all kinds from an “exciting” era ” which the author compares to “the old west.” It is the first time that all these concessions are represented topographically. Among the curiosities of the doctoral thesis, supported by cartographic data, it is found that the surface occupied by the concessions was about 18,000 hectares. In that area, similar to about 18,000 football fields, there were up to 1,200 active concessions simultaneously. This data reflects the concentration of companies and workers as well as the prosperity that La Unión, called “the new California”, had before the depopulation it suffered with the retraction of mining activity. Another piece of news about the mining legacy published this month refers to the participation of UPCT researchers in the Master Plan to protect and enhance the old sulfur mine in the Serrata de Lorca mountain range. 4th The School of Agronomists incorporates interactive learning in its Project subjects The School of Agricultural Engineers of the UPCT begins the course in September, launching subjects adapted to interactive learning.

UPCT researchers propose to disseminate the mining activity of the Sierra de Serrata mountain range in Lorca,"Just three kilometers from the city of Lorca is an unknown geological, paleontological and mining treasure. The Sierra de Serrata is pierced by more than two hundred mining access galleries and wells that were used for more than a century for the extraction of sulfur. Proposals for the protection and enhancement of this mining preserve are published in the Master Plan for the Mining-Industrial and Geological Heritage of the Sierra de Serrata, commissioned by the Lorca City Council, and carried out by the company Adara in collaboration with the department of Mining and Civil Engineering of the UPCT through the research group in Geotechnics and Exploitation Methods. “In the Serrata, a high percentage of its gypsum marl was transformed into sulfur when it came into contact with thermal waters rich in hydrocarbons. It was discovered when trying to cook the gypsum, as the yellow flashes typical of the combustion of sulfur were produced,” explains Emilio Trigueros, head of the research group, which has worked with historical documents from the 19th and 20th centuries, aerial photographs and cartographies. . “It has been exciting to discover a multitude of mining episodes at Coto Felicidad, and to understand what mining activity was like from a diversity of graphic and photographic sources. Now a research and dissemination horizon with great potential is opening up,” he adds. The initiatives that have been proposed in the Master Plan, directed by Myriam Ruiz of the Adara company, are aimed at protecting the most relevant assets, eliminating the risks for people who could travel through the area, and the ruin of the elements most important of the mining complex. The bases are provided for the dissemination of geological, paleontological and mining elements, designing the appropriate environment for this so that activities can be scheduled at different levels of research, education, culture and leisure. The Plan contemplates the creation of a monitoring commission in which the Lorca City Council, the general directorate of Cultural Assets and the Polytechnic University of Cartagena participate. “We hope that this collaboration can be promoted and dissemination activities initiated to make Lorca society aware of this treasure,” concludes Trigueros.",16,146

They develop neurologically inspired biomimetic robots that imitate human movements,"UPCT researchers have developed a biomimetic robotic hand and an algorithm that allows it to give orders, process and receive information from sensors, imitating the way the human brain does. These results are part of the work carried out in the doctoral thesis of Francisco García Córdova, currently a professor in the Department of Thermal and Fluid Engineering at the UPCT. The algorithm developed is much simpler than those currently used by robots, even those that use Artificial Intelligence, which opens the door to future developments. García “manages the variables in a less complex, faster and gentler way,” explains the co-director of the thesis, Toribio Fernández Otero, principal investigator of the Electro-Chemo-Biomimicry Experimental and Modeling group. During his doctoral thesis, García has managed to get this robotic hand to reproduce the gripping movements of a human being better than current robots do. Applications can be transferred to various fields. Among them, developing devices for medicine, such as making a probe that can bend as it passes through an artery and in a more precise way. It can also be applied in robotics and marine technology control systems. ""The muscle that we have developed in the Electrochemistry laboratories of the UPCT is such a natural adaptation that with the algorithm that we have developed it has the same actuating and sensing characteristics as human muscles, so it is capable of feeling cold or heat, fatigue or feel the weight, for example,” adds Professor García. Researchers have worked with tiny muscles, between a few millimeters and two centimeters in length, capable of holding the object stably and knowing its weight. García Córdova has developed algorithms for different types of electromechanical devices.

The UPCT patents how to accurately detect slurry leaks under ponds,"Technology from the marine sector at the service of pig farming. UPCT researchers have patented an innovative procedure to determine leaks in the subsoil of slurry storage ponds that uses profiles consisting of cables with thirty graphite electrodes connected to a resistivity meter, to perform a diagnostic electrical tomography of the subsoil. This invention allows direct collection of data on the slurry and has the advantage of not requiring any operator to access the interior of the pond, reducing risks and fine-tuning the three-dimensional mapping of possible leaks. Electrical tomography defines the resistivity values that occur in subsoil materials and in the areas where slurry accumulates. The data is confirmed and calibrated with the use of geochemical techniques that involve mechanical surveys and sampling at different depths that can reach fifteen meters, as well as permeability tests. “The goal is to have control of the possible impact of slurry on the subsoil and especially groundwater,” explains Ximena Capa Camacho, Geological Engineer who is carrying out a doctoral thesis in this line of research, with funding from the Seneca Foundation and under under the direction of professors Ángel Faz Cano and Pedro Martínez Pagán. Slurry, a by-product of pig farming composed mainly of pig manure, can be used for organo-mineral nutrition of the soil on agricultural farms, as various UPCT research has shown.

The work analyzes the acoustic performance of the multilayer panels used in the construction of ships based on tests carried out in the tank and the calibration pond that the CTN has in its facilities in the Fuente Álamo technology park. “We measure how the material contributes to dissipating sound,” explains the award-winning graduate. The characterized panels were provided by the company Sinergia Racing Group (SRG). “For years we have been working on the design, measurement and simulation of acoustic panels to reduce the noise and acoustic signature of ships and submarines,” explains Iván Felis, director of R&D+ at the CTN and co-director of the award-winning TFM along with the professor of the Carlos Mascaraque Naval School.",14,154
The Euclid telescope with technology developed at UPCT captures its first images of space,"The first test images from the Euclid space telescope have already arrived on Earth and validate the scientific instruments that have been developed by hundreds of researchers, including UPCT professors and students, coordinated by the European Space Agency. “After more than 11 years of design and development of the project, it is exciting and enormously emotional to see these first images,” says Euclid manager Giuseppe Racca. “It's even more incredible when we think that in these images we see just a few galaxies, but that with Euclid's fully calibrated instruments we will ultimately observe billions of galaxies to create the largest 3D map of the sky ever seen.” Yannick Mellier, leader of the Euclid consortium, adds that “the excellent first images obtained with the visible and near-infrared instruments open a new era for observational cosmology and statistical astronomy. “They mark the beginning of the search for the very nature of dark energy.” UPCT researchers Anastasio Díaz Sánchez and Antonio Pérez Garrido will analyze the images obtained by the telescope to reveal mysteries of the Universe such as the composition of dark matter or the number of planetary mass objects that exist in our galaxy but that we cannot see. Díaz is focused on the study of distant galaxies and Pérez, on the coldest objects in our Galaxy. Both scientific objectives will have the two instruments with which the Euclid telescope is equipped: the near-infrared spectrometer and photometer and the visible instrument. The UPCT has been responsible, in collaboration with the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands, for the design, construction and validation of the control electronics of the infrared instrument, “in charge of starting the equipment, maintaining the appropriate temperature for its correct operation, controlling the movements of the wheels and the calibration lamp, and monitor the telemetries that will allow us to react in case of anomalies”, summarizes the researcher from the Polytechnic of Cartagena Rafael Toledo Moreo. The Euclid spectrometer and photometer has a dual function: to obtain images of galaxies in infrared light and to measure the amount of light that galaxies emit at various wavelengths to calculate their distance. Combining this information with that of the visible instrument, a 3D map of the distribution of galaxies in the Universe and their evolution will be created, providing knowledge about dark matter and energy. Toledo and Díaz are the researchers responsible for the project 'Euclid Mission: UPCT contributions to the integration of the flight model and onboard software, preparation and scientific exploitation' (PID2019-110614GB-C22), funded by the State Research Agency, dependent on the Ministry of Science and Innovation. Pérez, for his part, is principal investigator of the national project 'Brown dwarfs and exoplanets: completing evolutionary models', with reference PID2020-120052GB-I00. Euclid is a space mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) with contributions from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Spain has an important role in the mission, with a prominent role in the consortium that has led the mission. On the one hand, the Institute of Space Sciences of the CSIC, the Institute of High Energy Physics (IFAE) and the Institute of Space Studies of Catalonia (IEEC) have been responsible for the design, construction, assembly and validation tests of the Assembly of the Filter Wheel of the infrared instrument, whose control unit has been developed by the UPCT in collaboration with the Astrophysicist of the Canary Islands. In addition, around 80 European companies participate in Euclid, of which nine are Spanish. In more than 20 Spanish institutions there are around a hundred scientists preparing the scientific exploitation of the mission to unravel the mysteries of the dark universe.",16,123
They find microplastics used in agriculture and boats on the coast of the Mar Menor and its sea bream,"Plastic waste is widely present on the beaches of the Mar Menor and in the stomachs and intestines of its fish, including species of commercial interest, as confirmed by Dolores Rojo Campillo's doctoral thesis at the Polytechnic University of Cartagena, in which plastic waste was analyzed. 17 wild bream and synthetic polymers were found in all of them. The doctoral research, directed by Francisco Javier Bayo Bernal and co-directed by Pedro Martínez Baños, has evaluated the presence of microplastics in coastal sediments of twelve beaches on the continental shore and the coastal range of the Mar Menor, as well as in the port of Cartagena and in Cala Cortina, where the presence of plastic waste is significantly lower, as indicated by the results of the analyses, which in the case of Cartagena Bay were carried out with financing from the Environment Chair of the Port Authority. On the beaches of the Mar Menor, an average of 52 microplastics were detected in each kilogram of dry coastal sediment. The identified particles had 13 different colors and came from 18 polymeric families, demonstrating their multiple origins. The most frequent polymers were low and high density polyethylenes and polyvinyls, used in agricultural materials and naval constructions, ""which points to agriculture, marinas and yacht clubs existing in the studied environment as sources of origin of these microplastics and establishes the need for an improvement in waste management and beach cleaning,” the researchers explain. Proximity to crops increases the concentration of microplastics, according to the thesis, which also indicates that the presence of vegetation could act as a containment element. In the gilthead sea bream studied, an average of 16 microplastics were found and more than 70% were fibers, “related to the breakage and loss of fishing nets and gear at sea,” the researchers point out. Nine families of polymers were identified, the most abundant being high and low density polyethylenes.",2,13

In search of dark matter from the UPCT,"The new doctor in Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) from the Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena José María García Barceló (Santo Ángel, 1994), whose thesis improves haloscopes to detect dark matter, will begin a postdoctoral contract in September at the prestigious Max Planck research center in Munich, whose scientists have won 38 Nobel Prizes. Trained in the bachelor's and master's degrees in Telecommunications Engineering at the UPCT, the young researcher has already published nine articles in high-impact scientific journals, has presented nine contributions at conferences and participated in two international research projects. And on three occasions he has collaborated in search campaigns for dark matter from the Axion Solar Telescope of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), in Geneva, where the largest Physics laboratory is located. of the world. “Dark matter is the great enigma of the universe,” explains García Barceló. “It does not emit light or any other form of electromagnetic radiation, so its existence is deduced from the gravitational effects it exerts on visible matter, as in the movement of stars and galaxies,” he adds, indicating that “discovering nature of this mysterious invisible mass has become one of the most important challenges in modern cosmology and particle physics.” To solve this great mystery, haloscopes are used, for the improvement of which the young researcher's thesis has developed an efficient electronic tuning system using ferroelectric materials and resonant cavities that increases the sensitivity of these axion detectors, the particles of which the dark matter. “We have achieved a greater measurement range to sweep the electromagnetic spectrum, ruling out frequencies where the axion may be,” details the UPCT graduate. “It is a search that can still take decades,” acknowledges the new doctor, who discovered his research vocation while doing his Master's Final Project on satellite filters and who obtained an FPI grant for the training of doctors. “I am passionate about physics and I have been able to address its great mysteries from the perspective of the engineer, applying technology,” he comments. The doctoral thesis uses waveguide technology, such as that used in the design of radiofrequency filters for satellite communications, and was directed by UPCT researchers Antonio José Lozano Guerrero and Alejandro Álvarez Melcón and by Benito Gimeno Martínez, from the University of Valencia . The work was carried out within the framework of the RADES group of collaboration between scientific institutions, in which García Barceló will continue to participate during his stay in Munich. All this research has been developed in the context of two research projects financed by the State Research Agency and with FEDER funds from the European Union, based on the CAST (CERN Axion Solar Telescope) and IAXO (International Axion Observatory) experiments: “ Development of band-pass filters based on microwave cavities for the detection of axions” (FPA2016-76978-C3-2-P) and “Haloscope design for detection of dark matter axions at high frequencies in BabyIAXO magnet and program development of small-scale CAST magnet demonstrators (PID2019-108122GB-C33), both led by the researcher from the Polytechnic of Cartagena Alejandro Díaz Morcillo.",14,77
TFG in 'Teleco' automates the identification of vessels by their acoustic frequencies,"The machine learning models for the identification of vessels by the frequency descriptors of their acoustic signature, tested by the graduate in Telecommunications Systems Engineering Rocío Sabariego Arenas, have won the Innovation Award in Underwater Technologies, in the category of best Work End of Degree, from the Isaac Peral de Navantia Chair at the UPCT. “Acoustic signatures are the result of the combination of sound emissions from maritime vessels and serve to identify them,” explains the award-winning graduate, who used acoustic frequency descriptors to classify and detect vessels from an audio database. of different ships, from sailboats to ocean liners, and train artificial intelligence neural networks to do it automatically. The machine learning techniques applied achieved successful identifications of almost all sounds coming from boats, as highlighted by the conclusions of the TFG directed by Juan Morales Sánchez.

Industry 4.0 tools to optimize water savings in agricultural crops,"Researchers from the UPCT School of Industrial Engineering have developed Industry 4.0 tools that, through big data, allow us to know when water can be saved in agricultural crops and, in this way, optimize consumption. It is software that uses and interprets data from multiple sensors and allows you to make decisions to save water. The tests have been carried out in 'La Majada', an experimental pomegranate cultivation farm of the Paloma group, located in Mazarrón, which has more than 130 sensors. The researchers have developed an open source platform that automates the download of data from IoT (Internet Of Things) sensors installed in agricultural plots, processes the information, analyzes it and offers indicators so that the agronomist knows, for example, if the plant is stressed and needs water. In this way “we optimize resources and minimize errors in the interpretation of data, in addition to sending automated notices through Telegram bots in case of incidents such as a level of water stress that is harmful to the plant or the failure of a sensor,” they say. Ana Toledo and Manuel Jiménez, directors of the Master's Thesis, of the Department of Automation, Electrical Engineering and Electronic Technology. Toledo and Jiménez have directed the Master's Thesis entitled “IoT Platform for the collection and visualization of agronomic data”, carried out by Adrián Saura Ródenas, student of the master's degree in Industry 4.0, coordinated by Antonio Guerrero. This development has been developed through the tests carried out in the research project PID2019-106226RB-C22 / AEI / 10.13039/501100011033, funded by the Ministry of Science and Innovation. Roque Torres, researcher responsible for the PRISMA group, Precision Systems for Agri-Food, Environmental and Social Sustainability, highlights that the software considerably reduces the time the agronomist needs to capture the information, perform mathematical calculations, analyze the data and extract the information from the sensors installed on the farms. The Precision Systems for Agri-Food, Environmental and Social Sustainability group has specialized for several years in the instrumentation and automation of agricultural and environmental systems for the optimal management of water resources. The results of their projects are being used in numerous agricultural farms in the Region of Murcia with the objective of optimizing and saving water.",14,52
"doctoral thesis quantifies the Sierra Minera concessions in more than 3,300 in 120 years of activity","More than 3,329 mining concessions in the Sierra Minera de Cartagena-La Unión in 120 years. It is the figure that appears in the doctoral thesis of Manuel Rosique Campoy, defended at the UPCT, on the historical evolution of this business activity, developed between 1841 and 1961. The work includes a cartographic reconstruction and data of all kinds from an “exciting” era ” which the author compares to “the old west.” It is the first time that all these concessions are represented topographically. Among the curiosities of the doctoral thesis, supported by cartographic data, it is found that the surface occupied by the concessions was about 18,000 hectares. In that area, similar to about 18,000 football fields, there were up to 1,200 active concessions simultaneously. This data reflects the concentration of companies and workers as well as the prosperity that La Unión, called “the new California”, had before the depopulation it suffered with the retraction of mining activity. The doctoral thesis provides the possibility of cartographically locating the properties declared BIC (Asset of Cultural Interest), including wells, castles, mining roads or washing places in the concession to which they belonged. “This information was known to the former miners, but today it had practically been lost,” says Rosique. Manuel Rosique has addressed other issues such as the orientation of the concessions. “At first they were oriented towards the vein. Then to magnetic north, which initially practically coincided with the direction of the mineral veins. Since the direction of magnetic north varies with time and position, in the end it was decided to take geographic or true north as a reference, which is invariable,” they explain. Hence the location errors in many of the concessions that have now been able to be quantified thanks to the cartographic study. Mining in La Unión had times of great splendor. The mining boom justified the segregation of La Unión from the municipality of Cartagena. It once had between 40,000 and 50,000 inhabitants. One of the traces is the modernist heritage preserved today in both municipalities. In the 2,431 mines that were exploited, lead, zinc, iron, manganese and tin were mainly extracted. “Resurgence” of mining The co-director of the thesis, Antonio García Martín, from the Department of Mining and Civil Engineering, warns that to face the ecological transition it would be necessary to multiply the current production of strategic minerals by 3.5, according to the Agency Energy International (IEA). “This may lead to a resurgence of mining, now linked to the climate objectives of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees by 2030,” he adds. The doctoral thesis has also been directed by Miguel Ángel López-Morell, professor of History and Economic Institutions at the University of Murcia. The work has been rated with the highest score: Outstanding Cum Laude. García Martín and Rosique Campoy are professors at the UPCT School of Civil and Mining Engineering.",8,15
Tests with an exoskeleton to analyze postures and efforts of healthcare and hospitality personnel,"New technologies applied to the Prevention of Occupational Risks. This is what researchers from the Polytechnic University of Cartagena are doing, who are testing an exoskeleton to analyze postures and efforts in hospitality workers and healthcare personnel. The researchers, in addition to using a motion capture system (Mocap) and surface EMG electromyography equipment, have incorporated an exoskeleton to compare the postures and efforts made during the work day when this device is used and when it is not used. says Lola Ojados, director of the investigation. The inclusion of the exoskeleton in the tests “will allow additional evaluations and comparisons to be made regarding the postures adopted and the efforts exerted by employees in their tasks with and without their help,” adds the researcher. Through the motion capture system (Mocap), researchers record and analyze body movements during work activity. In this way they obtain precise information about postures or range of movement, among other aspects. With electromyography equipment, they measure the muscular efforts made by workers, record the electrical activity of the muscles and obtain objective data on the physical load to which they are subjected during their daily work. This device, designed to assist and improve the user's biomechanics, provides valuable information for the research, ""Automation for ergonomic evaluation integrating virtual reality technologies, motion capture, surface electromyography and measurements of biological parameters.""

Award to Physics professor Juan Francisco González for his work on the behavior of probes,"If we were blind, we had to read a document in Braille and we could not touch it, we would have to analyze what we feel when we approach the paper to know the message of a text. That is what the researcher from the Department of Applied Physics of the UPCT Juan Francisco González has done in his work on the behavior of the probes used to measure the force of interaction with the surface. This research has won the award for best poster at the Fuerzas y Túnel congress, which brought together almost 200 international scanning near-field microscopy researchers this month in Zamora. The award-winning work, 'Circles, novel scheme to interpret linear and non-linear interactions in Dynamic AFM', is theoretical. “We relate the theory to observation on the oscilloscope,” indicates the researcher, from the Advanced Materials for Energy Production and Storage group. The conclusions of the work on atomic force microscopy will allow the researcher to analyze in real time the interaction of the probe with the surface to be measured, according to González.

The UPCT searches the Milky Way with the Euclid spacecraft for ultracold objects: unknown stars and planets,"Researchers from the Polytechnic University of Cartagena (UPCT) will scrutinize the images obtained by the Euclid space telescope, launched this month from Cape Canaveral, to solve mysteries of both the most distant galaxies and the Milky Way itself, in which they will be observed like never before the so-called ultracold objects, for whose study the infrared instruments used in this mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) in which the UPCT participates are essential. Lower mass, and therefore cooler and fainter, astronomical objects resulting from star formation are known as ultracold objects. Their masses are less than one tenth of the mass of the sun. These astronomical objects are of particular interest, as they include both very low-mass stars that fuse hydrogen slowly, and brown dwarfs, which have insufficient mass to sustain hydrogen fusion in their cores, cooling over time, as well as extrasolar planets. , whose atmospheres have been beginning to be studied in recent years. Brown dwarfs “These ultracold objects are important for understanding the evolution and behavior of stellar systems,” explains UPCT professor Antonio Pérez Garrido. “Due to its low mass, temperature and luminosity, its study provides valuable information about the early stages of star formation, the extreme conditions in astrophysical environments and the chemical enrichment routes of the galaxy,” he details. “Brown dwarfs, in particular, are the subject of great interest in astronomy due to their unique properties. They are considered 'failed stars' since they failed to accumulate enough mass to initiate nuclear fusion of hydrogen and become true stars,” adds the researcher from the Astrophysics and Condensed Matter group at the Polytechnic of Cartagena. ""The telescope's infrared instruments will allow us to carry out a systematic study of these objects, the nature of which is still very little known, especially those of low metallicity, which were born in the initial stages of our galaxy,"" says the person responsible in the UPCT of the Euclid Project Milky Way Objects Working Group. One of the objectives is the search for planetary mass objects, “stars that are floating in space without orbiting around any other object. It is believed that their number could be greater than the number of stars, but due to their weakness, only a few are known,” indicates the professor, who teaches at the UPCT School of Telecommunications and discovered a giant exoplanet in 2015. Researchers from the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands and the Astrobiology Center of the CSIC also participate in this scientific exploitation of the mission, as well as scientists from other countries integrated into Euclid's 'Milky Way and Resolved Stellar Population Science Working Group'. This line of work is part of the project 'Brown dwarfs and exoplanets: completing evolutionary models', with reference PID2020-120052GB-I00 and funded by the Ministry of Science and Innovation (MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033), of which Antonio Pérez Garrido is the main researcher. The UPCT will also study with the images of this mission the most distant galaxies of the Milky Way and mysteries of the Universe such as dark matter, in a project led by the professor of the Polytechnic of Cartagena Anastasio Díaz. In addition, UPCT researchers coordinated by researcher Rafael Toledo have participated in the development of modules for the control unit of one of the observation instruments of this space telescope.",8,123

In search of a hidden image of Salzillo since July 1936,"July 25, 1936. The sculpture of San Antonio de Padua, by Salzillo, disappears from the church of San Diego, in Cartagena. Today marks 87 years. The whereabouts remain unknown. Researchers from the Polytechnic University of Cartagena (UPCT) are using a revolutionary method to try to locate this image, which was lost days after the outbreak of the Civil War, in the midst of a wave of anticlerical violence. According to reliable clues, she could be found walled up in the building. Researchers from the schools of Civil and Mining Engineering and Architecture and Building use one of the few georadar equipment used in Europe, says Professor Josefina García León. It is the first time that this technology is used in the Region of Murcia. The georadar technology used is ideal to respect the architectural heritage. It is not invasive nor does it require works on the property, comment the researchers of the Somera Applied Geophysics group (GEODE) Pedro Martínez Pagán and Marcos Martínez Segura. Researchers have worked with historians. In the archives there is no evidence that this Salzillo sculpture was vandalized or burned. They also have reliable oral testimonies that affirm that it is walled inside the temple. Despite all this, his whereabouts remain a mystery. The investigation, which began in 2022, has not yet found this sculpture that disappeared during the Civil War, but it has confirmed the presence of hidden holes in the temple in places where it was not structurally necessary and where, due to its size, there could be walled state. One of them is oratory. The work carried out so far has also made it possible to rule out where Salzillo's sculpture is not located. García León and Pedro E. Collado Espejo, from the Thermal Analysis And Geomatics group, remember that the parish of San Diego preserves a San José de Salzillo that on the same date was hidden by a family during the civil war and later returned to the Church. Students from the UPCT master's degree in Architectural Heritage participate in this multidisciplinary research. It is carried out in collaboration with the historian Miguel Ángel Ríos Sanmartín and at the request of the parish priest of San Diego, Pascual Saorín.",14,77

Lina Sanmartín: «I am going to continue fighting so that there is cultural offer for seniors»,"""My children told me I was crazy, but it was my pending subject,"" is how Lina Sanmartín explains her enormous interest in enrolling in the University of Seniors, when it was established in Murcia, and for bringing it to Cartagena, 20 twenty years ago. ""I had to start working at the age of 16 instead of continuing to study, and like many people of my generation, that's why I complained at all levels and even got the education councilor at the time to donate 6,000 euros to start the University of Seniors in Cartagena"", recalls the founder of the Student Association of the University of Seniors (UMAY), for whom the training offer for people over 50 years of age is an investment in mental health. ""Coming to university is another life, another level of activity and social relationships. It has been very helpful to the hundreds of students at the University of Seniors, especially for those who, like me, had been widowed and were going through an emotional rough patch,"" he explained. today in the Rectorate, where he met with the vice-rector for Students, Culture and Sports, Sergio Amat, to begin preparations for a commemorative event for the 20th anniversary. The 'jet set' ""The first course was a success and I hope that many of us from that first class can join together, despite the fact that sadly some have died,"" says Sanmartín, who came accompanied by another of the first students from the University of Seniors in Cartagena, Marisa Segura, for whom ""thanks to Lina's encouragement, many older people from Cartagena have enjoyed a great cultural offering."" ""The classrooms at the University of Seniors are very plural, with more or less elderly people, even foreign retirees, students without prior training, but also engineers and even the 'jet set' of Cartagena have signed up,"" he lists.

UPCT researchers develop a methodology to prevent building collapses,"Researchers from the UPCT School of Roads and Mines have developed a methodology capable of preventing building collapses. It is a combination of geophysical techniques to identify the presence of holes and cavities in the subsoil and, thus, prevent the deterioration and collapse of buildings. This new tool is part of the international doctoral thesis, defended by Oussama Jabrane and rated with the highest score: Outstanding Cum Laude. Somera Applied Geophysics researchers have tested the methodology in the Sierra de Gádor (Almería) and in the Moroccan city of Fez. The work confirms the advantages of knowing the holes and cavities in the subsoil to avoid building on that surface and, therefore, avoiding cracks and the inevitable collapse of some buildings, explains Pedro Martínez Pagán, co-director of the doctoral thesis. The methodology is easy to apply. It is non-invasive, there is no need to excavate the ground, the sensors are easily installed in the ground. The equipment is transportable. Furthermore, the results are known quickly and allow large areas to be evaluated. Currently, the detection of cavities in the subsoil is carried out through surveys, which are invasive, says the professor. The conclusions are applicable to areas with similar problems, including several in the Spanish Southeast. Field work has studied one of the known 'sinkholes' of the Sierra de Gádor, that is, structures made of calcareous material, and they have concluded that this methodology identifies these areas with great precision and reliability. In Fez they have located cavities in the subsoil that have been the cause of the damage suffered by various buildings in the city, explains Martínez, coordinator of the university master's degree in Mining Engineering. Oussama Jabrane has completed his doctoral thesis in the Technology and Modeling program in Civil, Mining and Environmental Engineering. It was co-directed by the professor at the University of Fèz, Driss El Azzab. During his thesis, Jabrane completed two stays at the UPCT through the KA-107 international mobility program of Erasmus+.",11,36

"Artificial Intelligence in university teaching: ""Yes, but with critical and ethical thinking""","Is Artificial Intelligence here to stay? Has AI burst into our lives or are we experiencing an unprecedented boom? How to make it an appropriate tool for teachers and students? These are some of the questions that professors Soledad Martínez and María del Mar Andreu, from the Department of Quantitative Methods and Legal Sciences, have answered. The researchers presented the latest trends at the II international conference “Education 4.0: Current issues on university teaching” held at the UPCT. María del Mar Andreu, professor of Commercial Law, points out about the lights and shadows of the use of artificial intelligence in university teaching that AI “is an undeniable reality. We have to teach our students these digital tools, but with critical and ethical thinking.” Soledad Martínez, professor of Management Informatics, remembers that there are already about 150 million active GPT chat users in the world and that this is not the only generative artificial intelligence tool that is available. Martínez, about Artificial Intelligence: Chat GPT and other tools, states: “we will have to use it and teach how to do it but always applied in a creative, critical and coherent way,” considers the teacher, “to know how, when and why and for what to use it”, he adds. Martínez agrees with Professor Andreu that AI is not something new. “It has been present in our lives for a long time and we have normalized it, for example, in the use of biometric data recognition on our phones, in the optimization of routes of some large companies or in the suggestions on music streaming platforms or series”, they indicate. The teachers consider that the development and implementation of technology is currently going much faster than any regulatory development. The way in which the new AI systems will be implemented on university campuses will depend on the different regulations that are trying to regulate them at the European and national level. In any case, the digital competences of our students are already increasing, following the European Framework for the Digital Competence of Educators (DigCompEdu) that develops it.",14,110
The metaverse in the classrooms,"The metaverse allows you to recreate what are called learning scenarios. What does that mean? The most practical example is a class on occupational risk prevention. You may not be able to take students into a real world of danger, but you can take them into a virtual reality environment where they are not in danger. These are some of the advantages presented by Juan Suardíaz, professor of Electronic Technology at the UPCT, at the II International Congress “Education 4.0: Current issues on university teaching”, held recently at the Faculty of Business Sciences. For Suardíaz, the main advantages of bringing the metaverse to the classrooms are: “being able to offer immersive situations that in real life are almost impossible to carry out and taking advantage of the internal layer of artificial intelligence that this environment offers to create personalized learning routes” . It is an experiential learning that allows learning without leaving the classroom, gamified, dynamic. The use of avatars and roles allows shy students to interact much more than they do in reality, contributing to their socialization, adds Suardíaz. During his speech, the professor cited “The Metaverse and eLearning as learning tools” disadvantages of this platform. “We are now like when the Internet began and words that are common to us now, such as email, were strange to us back then. The main current barrier is that many of these devices necessary to develop or use them are still expensive. The development of this virtual world requires intense programming work that increases costs. While its origins date back to the 1980s film Tron, the term metaverse first appeared in Neal Stephenson's 1992 novel “Snow Crash.” At first, the technological capacity to develop it was very limited by the power of the computers of the time, but in 2003 the Second Life platform emerged, which is the longest-running platform that exploits this concept. Since then it has evolved very quickly. Large companies are already dabbling in it and opening stores in the metaverse.",4,155

The UPCT meteorite,"In literature, the best-known asteroid is B 612, where the character 'The Little Prince' originates. At UPCT it is the meteorite fragment donated by a graduate and that can be observed through one of the microscopes in the Mining Laboratory. The core of the planet is nothing more than an asteroid, says Emilio Trigueros, researcher in the Geotechnics and Exploitation Methods group. “A small asteroid upon entering the atmosphere melts and becomes a meteorite. And it looks like it's a shooting star. In fact, shooting stars are meteors,” explains Anastasio Díaz, researcher in the Astrophysics and Condensed Matter group. Today, International Asteroid Day, the School of Roads and Mines offers as a curiosity the meteorite fragment donated by its graduate Armando Jiménez Belando, mining engineer. Students who pass through the Mining Laboratory can see this sample through the microscope and appreciate the ferronickel structures. “It is impossible to obtain a fragment of planet Earth due to the time the crystals need to cool,” says Trigueros. On June 30, 1908, a meteorite hit Tunguska, Siberia, felling trees in an area of 2,150 km², as well as causing a large fire.

Smart furniture plays an important role in promoting active and healthy aging,"The doctoral thesis of researcher Francisco Melero entitled ""ICT solutions for active and healthy aging at home, in the workplace and in society"" has been developed at the Furniture and Wood Technology Center of the Region of Murcia (CETEM) under the framework of two European initiatives: the Pharaon project of large-scale pilots for active and healthy aging, and the COST action CA16226 Sheldon on intelligent environments for older people, achieving the rating of Outstanding Cum Laude. This thesis is supported by more than half a dozen scientific articles in high-impact journals, is directed by Dr. María Victoria Bueno Delgado, principal researcher of the Telecommunications Network Engineering group of the Department of Information and Communications Technologies, and co-directed by Dr. Josefina Garrido Lova, director of R&D at CETEM, and whose subject is related to Information and Communications Technologies: smart furniture, remote healthcare, telemedicine, e-health solutions, etc. with impact at a social level, especially for the adult population. Doctoral student Francisco Melero is responsible for the international projects department at CETEM, an entity with a close relationship with the UPCT, with both entities collaborating on half a dozen European projects. “The industries in the habitat sector, in general, and furniture, in particular, are continually innovating towards the design and development of solutions that help active and healthy aging in society, at home and in the work environment,” Melero has indicated in his work. The presentation of this doctoral thesis, defended on June 2, is carried out under the modality of ""Compendium of Publications"", and shows the result of several years of work within the framework of three lines of research related to active aging and e-solutions. -health and Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) for the older population: Smart furniture and smart spaces; active and healthy aging; and Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) solutions focused on health care, in general, and older people, in particular. He has stated that in a European society that is aging rapidly, it is increasingly necessary to apply ICT solutions and digital tools that improve the quality of life, independence and general health of the older population. In this context, the concept of Ambient Intelligence (AmI) appears to achieve a future in which technology surrounds users and helps them in their daily lives. In relation to smart furniture, Francisco Melero has highlighted its properties in terms of functionality and the use of active and connected digital elements. Furthermore, it should be considered as an entity integrated into the concept of smart cities or quality of life. Therefore, state-of-the-art research focuses on the aging workforce, recent trends, future directions, and aging at work. The objective, according to Melero, is “to propose effective responses that support aging at work and e-health solutions that allow the senior population to live independently for longer, through digital solutions capable of addressing the challenges of services and -health in rural areas, such as a telecare system based on proactive care, active aging, prevention and the needs of users and their environments.” This thesis has indicated that “home automation or home automation, along with telemedical care services, are part of the AAL market. Within this concept, smart and multifunctional furniture plays an important role in promoting health and well-being, managing physical and mental frailty, as well as other impairments caused by aging.” Also, it helps reduce the impact of those physical and cognitive barriers that prevent workers from remaining active and productive in their workplace during the last years of their working life.",3,17
Approved the European guideline for research on the large-scale piloting of the Pharaon Project in which the UPCT participates,"The proposal to prepare a specification on “Research guides for the development of large-scale pilot projects” has been approved, which begins to be developed in the month of July, in which the Polytechnic University of Cartagena participates. This specification aims to establish common criteria and good practices to design, implement and evaluate the pilot projects carried out within the framework of the Pharaon project and other similar projects. The proposal has been published by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) and the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC). Under the framework of the Sheldon network, the Pharaon project (Pilots for Healthy and Active Aging) was born, an international technological project to promote active aging and reduce unwanted loneliness among older people, through different technological solutions. In this initiative, in which the main researcher of the Telecommunications Network Engineering group of the UPCT, Victoria Bueno, participates, a pioneer in promoting active and healthy aging, 41 entities at the European level from 12 countries participate, carrying out six technological experiences. on a large scale in five countries, Italy (Tuscany and Apulia), Slovenia (Izola), the Netherlands (Twente), Portugal (Coimbra and Amadora), and Spain (Andalusia and Murcia), from 2020 and for four years, to respond to the needs of older people and improve their capabilities, independence and security. The Region of Murcia is the setting for one of Pharaon's pilot tests, which aims to build a bridge between technological challenges and active and healthy aging, and seeks to establish the foundations of a new telecare system. This system will go beyond the current in-person model that is activated when patients need help, allowing users to remain at home while offering them a more personalized, non-intrusive and efficient care service. Through the development of these real pilot experiences in different European cities, the bases are established and unified the technological challenges that the aging of the population will bring with it in the coming years. To achieve this objective, improve the quality of life of both older people and their caregivers, Pharaon has an endowment of 21 million euros, financed by the Research and Innovation Program, Horizon 2020 of the European Union. The Pharaon project contributes significantly to the European Union's agenda on active and healthy ageing. Specifically, it is about creating a set of interoperable and customizable platforms equipped with services and devices based on the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence (AI), robotics, cloud computing, wearable technology or Big Data. In addition, these platforms will interact with more systems in the fields of health, energy or transportation, among others.",3,155

Last summer, the UPCT Scientific Culture Unit took its outreach workshops to the Fan Futura festival in San Javier.",14,109
Future female engineers already represent 25% of UPCT students,"""Gender, where engineering suffers from a historical imbalance that has not yet been corrected, is configured as one of the main challenges and at the same time opportunities not only for the profession but for society as a whole."" This is stated in the first Study of the Spanish Engineering Observatory 2022, which vindicates the role of engineering in the economy and the potential of women in the sector. The gender analysis carried out by the Observatory concludes that women have a global presence in engineering in Spain close to 20%. The specialty where there are the fewest women is Telecommunications engineering, with only 12%. This is followed by Computer Engineering and Industrial Engineering with 16% and 19%, respectively. On the other hand, the disciplines that have the highest proportion of female engineers are Agricultural engineering - up to a third of the professionals are female engineers - and Civil engineering, as well as the specialties grouped under the heading ""Others"". In both cases the figure reaches 24%. At UPCT, 25.8% of engineering students are women. The data exceeds the percentage of the study at the national level. By schools, 33.9% of Agronomists students are women. 31.8%, from Roads and Mines; 31%, in Navales; 25% study Industrials; 18%, Telecommunications. In the School of Architecture, it happens that 38.4% of Building Engineering students are women. STEM promotion The UPCT, the only Spanish polytechnic led by a woman, develops different programs to promote STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) vocations from an early age. The Scientific Culture and Innovation Unit develops different initiatives throughout the year. In the opinion of Lola Ojados, director of SEDIC (Service of Industrial Design and Scientific Calculation), there is “a great lack of knowledge of what the engineering profession itself is.” The industrial engineer doctor states that “the professions of the future will depend a lot on there being people trained in the disciplines with which we work in engineering.” Therefore, it is essential to promote these disciplines among the youngest. Ojados highlights the high employability rate, which contrasts with the figures for STEM vocations. If the age distribution of each field of engineering is analyzed, a growth of interest in the profession is observed until reaching the last decade, in which 40% of the specific weight of engineers under 35 years of age is reached, according to the study. of the Observatory. Engineering emerged as a profession in the 17th century. Since then, many women engineers have left their mark around the world. Examples of female contributions to engineering are pioneering women such as Ada Lovelace, considered the first programmer in history, and Hedy Lamarr, actress and scientist who developed key technologies for wireless communications. Today, there are prominent women engineers in various fields, such as astronaut and space scientist Ellen Ochoa, civil engineer Emily Warren Roebling, who oversaw the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge. Women's Day in Engineering Every June 23, International Women's Day in Engineering is celebrated, a date declared by UNESCO to recognize and promote the participation of women in the field of engineering. World Women in Engineering Day was established in 2014 at the initiative of the Women's Engineering Society (WES) in the United Kingdom, with the aim of celebrating the achievements of women in the field of engineering and encouraging more women to pursue this race.",5,46

An Industrial PhD student develops a submersion control system for underwater profilers,"The student of the Industrial Technologies Doctorate program, Isabel Morales Aragón, has developed a dynamic control system that allows modifying the buoyancy of a sensor-bearing profiler for monitoring and future sampling in the Mar Menor. This work, developed by the research group Precision Systems for Agri-Food, Environmental and Social Sustainability (PRISMA) of the UPCT for environmental monitoring, won one of the 2022 Innovation Awards in Underwater Technology from the Isaac Peral Chair of Navantia and a runner-up prize for the best TFM from the College of Industrial Engineers. The system has been refined and tested in the test tank that the group has installed at the Industrial School. “The tank allows us to see what happens underwater without using divers and thus we have verified and corrected the effects of pressure on the piston and the depth sensor,” details the doctoral student. Isabel's collaboration as a scholarship recipient from the Department of Automation, Electrical Engineering and Electronic Technology resulted in the Master's Thesis in Industrial Engineering that has just been awarded by the Navantia chair and has given rise to the beginning of a research career that now continues in the doctoral program in Industrial Technologies. His TFM was directed by Roque Torres and Pencho Soto, also responsible, together with Javier Gilabert, for the underwater profiler project. The first versions of this profiler are currently being used by the Mar Menor Observatory, a body belonging to IMIDA in CARM, to monitor the state of the lagoon water. The doctoral student is developing new improvements in the profilers, optimizing their depth control systems. “We are using dynamic ballasts and thus modify the weight/thrust ratio of the device as an alternative with lower energy consumption to the propellants that the buoys have,” explains the young researcher.",14,77

Mathematics: now in theaters,"The pre-university students Elena Chacón, Valeria Hernández and María Esther Vignacq have presented at the IDIES congress the work 'Mathematics: already in cinemas', tutored by UPCT researchers Sergio Amat and Sonia Busquier. The objective of the work has been to study the mathematical tools used in cinema, which are used both for the creation of animations and for image processing. Specifically, they have focused on analyzing the Chaikin algorithm, well known in the cinematographic field. The main disadvantage of this tool is that it does not respect discontinuities when creating approximations of the image control points, essential to compress their size. In this way, the students have developed a new algorithm based on the previous one. Unlike Chaikin, the new tool does allow you to create approximations of the control points respecting the discontinuities, which saves time in the process of manually correcting the images.

"Cementless concrete for the ""Station of the Future"" project","What will the seasons be like in 50, 100 or 500 years? Will they still exist or will they just be a memory of the past? What new functions, features or uses will they have? What role will stations play in the city of the future? What materials can be used to be more durable and sustainable?... These are some questions that researchers from the Advanced Construction Science and Technology Group (CTAC) are trying to solve. CTAC researchers from the UPCT School of Architecture and Building participate, together with other entities, in the creation of the strategic document ""Future Station"", promoted by the Spanish Construction Technology Platform and the Railway Innovation Hub. The objective is to present a reference model of the Station of the Future in the railway field. Model that optimally incorporates technological developments and trends, already in development or planned in the short and medium term, integrating aspects of sustainability and integration. “The CTAC research group has contributed to the creation of this document and will continue working on lines of research focused on the development of new construction materials, architectural recycling or sustainable mobility; always from a vision committed to the city and the environment,” according to Carlos Parra, principal researcher of the group and director of the UPCT School of Architecture. This initiative has had the participation of 41 entities, including companies, technology centers and universities, a clear example of collaboration between platforms and which represents a valuable contribution to the advancement of the industry. It represents a reference and consultation document for the different agents involved in the construction and management of this infrastructure, as well as for the ideation of new proposals. According to José María Mateo and Elvira Carrión, collaborating researchers of the CTAC group, they have presented a reference model of railway stations for the medium and long term in a changing and unstable context. Both investigated what the new materials and construction systems of the station of the future could be, as well as the way in which these should be inserted in the city of tomorrow; responding to the main challenges that cities face: sustainability, accessibility, equality or security. Innovative materials In this sense, the CTAC group has put some innovative materials on the table, such as concrete without traditional cement (geopolymers) in which selected construction waste is used as cementing material. “To develop these cement-free concretes, we can start from the recovery of a multitude of waste, from industrial waste, slag, ash or dust to the food or forestry industry,” explains Carlos Parra. Other types of more sustainable concrete that the CTAC group has researched and developed are: ecological concrete or bioconcrete, which helps improve a city from an environmental and air quality point of view, increasing the quality of life and health of the population. population; sustainable lightweight concrete, which helps reduce the weight of buildings and can contribute positively to dynamic earthquake actions; and self-healing concrete, which has certain crack self-healing capabilities under specific conditions. This report aims to contribute to the improvement of the construction sector through public-private cooperation in research, development and innovation, carried out between companies, business associations, universities, research centers, technology centers and customers.

Current situation of the labor market for people with disabilities,"The conclusions of the study on the current situation of the labor market for people with disabilities are clear: discrimination when hiring people with disabilities exists, since there are companies that remain reluctant to do so. Furthermore, the study concludes that women with disabilities suffer double discrimination due to the existing gender gap. This is stated by pre-university students Blanca Buendía and Puri Belén Sánchez, tutored by UPCT researchers María Eugenia Sánchez Vidal and David Cegarra Leiva. According to the study, the higher a person's degree of disability, the more difficult it is for them to access the labor market. The study also addresses the importance and need to facilitate their labor integration as a form of social inclusion. The students have analyzed the difficulty that people with disabilities have when finding employment. To do this, they have taken data from the INE and the EPA, and have conducted interviews with the person in charge of a special employment center and a human resources expert.

"Lola Cano: ""Europe needs half a million Cybersecurity professionals""","The professor at the UPCT School of Telecommunications, Lola Cano, has been interviewed on Onda Regional for the Plaza Pública program to discuss the topic “Cybercrime, a worrying and rising problem in Spain.” In the current panorama there is a shortage of cybersecurity professionals around the world, for which it is necessary to train in these skills and cover these skills, since it is one of the most sought after professions. In this sense, the UPCT promotes a master's degree to train security professionals, within the Telecommunications engineering degree. There are limited places, based on a flexible methodology and includes customization and updating. This is how Lola Cano, director of the online Master's Degree in Cybersecurity at the School of Telecommunications, explained it, adding that “there are three editions of the master's degree, focused on professionals, not only in Computer Science and Telecommunications, but also in Criminalistics and Marketing studies. , and they register from all over Spain, don't be afraid, since very technical knowledge is not required."" The researcher has recognized the vital importance of cybersecurity, which faces important challenges, ""since cybersecurity teams lack sufficient personnel and the threats are going to increase, it is essential to train new talent."" Europe needs half a million Cybersecurity professionals Regarding the ransomware virus, one of the most worrying threats, in which cybercriminals hijack a company's information and demand a ransom to restore access, he has said emphatically that “the threats are in “There is an increase in companies and cybercriminals are using increasingly sophisticated extortion techniques to overcome security controls.” “One of the concerns of cybersecurity professionals are Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) companies: a whole business, they are organized crime companies, in which the cybercriminal demands money, especially in cryptocurrencies, bitcoins. Bad guys can try to attack security infinite times, but if they get it right once is enough,” he remarked. Furthermore, he stated that “according to the European Commission, in a study from April 2023, in Europe there is a skills gap in cybersecurity, there is a lack of half a million professionals. And there are up to 700,000 vacancies in the US, according to another study from March.” Lola Cano has warned that “ransomware” attacks are threats that companies and institutions have to face today: “No one is free, both in public administrations and in private companies.” In the face of a computer attack, zero risk does not exist. The objective is to minimize those impacts, risks, that may occur.” As examples, he has revealed that there are several hospitals that have been affected and, without a doubt, Google had a very strong attack five years ago. In addition, there are patterns, the attacks also coincide with electoral events. Regarding Artificial Intelligence technology - which are algorithms and data - and that Google uses them to increase the type of visualization, the director of the Cybersecurity master's degree has indicated that “many of the threats are created by AI tools, another problem, because they are capable of generating content, and how is it possible to differentiate content created by humans from content created by AI?” “AI in the wrong hands causes several threat dangers, including social and personal destabilization. AI tends to deceive to achieve an objective, even if it involves deception,” Lola Cano stressed. Finally, he revealed that any device that has an Internet connection is an access point for cybercriminals, such as a mobile phone: “In the case of cleaning robot vacuum cleaners, they can take photos of the home, with the aim of doing better their cleaning task, for example, but they could take compromising photos of people using the bathroom.”",2,59
They develop bioinspired robots and drones that imitate the resilience of human beings,"They model neurons and different areas of the brain, program mathematical models and introduce them into robots and drones. It has been developed by researchers from the UPCT School of Industrial Engineering, led by Antonio Guerrero, from the Systems and Automatic Engineering department. “They imitate the resilience of human beings, that is, the possibility of reconfiguring themselves despite suffering damage or breakdowns without ceasing to function properly,” adds the professor. The work has allowed the development of new bioinspired control systems for underwater drones and autonomous ships. The novelty is that they are capable of avoiding obstacles during navigation. They modify their trajectory, just like a person does when they encounter an object. “These advances are already being applied to marine robotics. It will allow robots to adapt to the adversities of the sea, as aquatic animals do,” explains Guerrero. The tests of the drones and boats have been carried out in the Mar Menor and on the coast near the bay of Cartagena. On the other hand, researchers have developed completely bioinspired algorithms that are used for the navigation of drones and autonomous robots. The models represent the motor cortex of the brain, that is, the areas that are used to make spatial movements. These works are part of the international thesis of Professor Francisco García Córdova, directed by Professors Antonio Guerrero and Toribio Fernández. The doctoral thesis, entitled 'Bio-inspired neural control algorithms for applications in biomimetic robotics', defended this month, has received the highest qualification: Outstanding Cum Laude.",14,167
Displaced to be able to study at the University,"Living and studying in a country at war is complicated. “The siren sounds at 4 in the morning. You have to go to the bunker. At 6 in the morning you come home again, try to sleep in bed for a couple of hours and at 8:00 you go to the University. Plus, you can run out of internet or electricity at any time.” Despite this, which Kateryna Pasternak has experienced firsthand, young people like her or Maksym Kriuchkov have decided to continue with their university studies. They have been forced to leave and/or be away from their country due to the armed conflict. Their stories describe two refugee lives that have begun anew. They live as displaced people to be able to study. Kateryna and Maksym are two of the four students who are studying at UPCT this year thanks to a tuition scholarship awarded to refugees and displaced people. They are students of the Industrial Engineering and Telecommunications schools of the UPCT. The vice-rectorate of Students launched the call to help talented young people displaced or affected by the war in Ukraine. Kateryna arrived at UPCT a month after the war in Ukraine began. He is 19 years old. His parents and sister are in his country. They sent her here so she can continue her studies. He continues studying his degree in Computer Science in Ukraine, at the Ivan Franko National University of Lviv, in online mode. It is combined with the first year of the degree in Data Science and Engineering, which he takes at the UPCT School of Telecommunications. The student says that she arrived without knowing a single word of Spanish. He started going to Spanish classes taught by the Juan Carrión Foundation at UPCT. Kateryna states that the war has changed her life. ""Everything is different. Life is darker now. It's difficult to me. “I have stress, anxiety and, above all, I feel a lot of pain and a lot of helplessness for my people,” he says. The first months of the armed conflict, Kateryna was “prepared to fight and fight with my own hands but my parents asked me to come to Spain. My compatriots are there. They protect us all the time with their own lives. Some are dying so that the rest of us can live well,” adds Kateryna. His goal now is to finish his studies and be able to work in Spain “to give back to this country what it is doing for me. Afterwards, I want to return to Ukraine to help build my homeland,” he adds. For his part, Maksym Kriuchkov, 21, is studying his second year of Mechanical Engineering. It hurts him not to be able to see his family and not to be able to go to his country. But he is even more saddened by having lost his 22-year-old friend. ""Artem was fighting on the front when a bullet pierced his heart,"" he laments emotionally. The young man affirms that the suffering ""is felt here, in Spain. My family is in Ukraine. I can't visit them. I can't see my elderly grandparents, my family, my friends. Life is difficult. Here we also have to face difficulties and not just economic ones."" Maksym is grateful for the opportunity that the UPCT, Spanish institutions and citizens and having obtained refugee status and, thanks to that, being able to study at the University or be able to get a driving license. This student was in Spain when the war broke out in his country. He obtained his status as a refugee thanks to a professor from the Industrial School asking him to help a group of 30 Ukrainians who had just arrived in our Region. “They gave it to all of us at the same time,” the young man remembers. On June 20, Every year, the world commemorates World Refugee Day, a day to honor people who have been forced to flee their homes, according to the UN Refugee Agency. Currently there are more than 70 million displaced people in the world.",10,153

"Javier Bayo: «We must not demonize plastics, but rather reduce their use, reuse and recycle»","The professor of the Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Javier Bayo, has stated that plastics should not be demonized, but rather reduce their use on a personal level, minimize use, reuse and recycle. This was stated by the researcher this Thursday during an interview on 'Everything is a lie', Risto Mejide's daily program on Cuatro. During the interview, Bayo - Eut+ coordinator for International Networks and Global Development, said that ""Microplastics have a sufficient size (between 5 mm and 1 µm), so it is very easy for them to be transported through water, air..."" The presenter of the program Marta Flich posed various questions to Bayo about the study from Australia, published this week in the journal Physics of Fluids, in which it is stated that People inhale around 16.2 pieces of microplastics every hour, which is equivalent to a plastic credit card every week. According to study co-author YuanTong Gu, a professor at the Queensland University of Technology in Australia, this study highlights the need for greater awareness about the presence and potential effects for the health of microplastics in the air we breathe. In this sense, for Bayo, ingestion may not be as problematic as inhalation, which is what they have been studying at the UPCT: “We are seeing pulmonary patients who have microplastics in their lungs ”. He assures that “there is no part of the human being that is free of this material, but what is truly dangerous is at the lung level.” Microplastics, which contain toxic substances, are commonly inhaled by humans due to the degradation of plastic products in the environment, and these are sticking to human airways, according to experts.",11,123

Professor Ino Martínez highlights the importance of women against desertification,"Women. Desertification. Drought. These three words are joined by a global dimension, affecting numerous regions of the world. The motto chosen in 2023 for World Day against Desertification is: 'Woman. Their lands. Your rights'. Ino Martínez, professor in the Department of Business Economics, highlights the importance of women against desertification. For the Coordinator of the University Master's Degree in Management of Social Economy Entities, women have always played a fundamental role. “It is women who manage natural resources: land, water, since they are the ones who generally take care of their gardens and are in charge of managing their environment. In addition, “they take care of plant and animal species, promoting their conservation and biodiversity,” he adds. And also, “they recognize the importance of the environment,” he adds. This is the reflection of Professor Ino Martínez on World Desertification Day about the motto “Woman. Their lands. Their rights"". The role of women against Desertification. The importance of their lands and rights. Women have traditionally played a fundamental role in rural areas. In 1992, at the conference known as the “Earth Summit”, held In Rio de Janeiro, negotiations began at the international level on issues related to the environment and development. Likewise, the Rio Declaration (emerging from this conference) defined the rights and obligations of States with respect to the basic principles on the environment and development, and the key idea was formulated, among others, the conviction that the full participation of women was considered essential to achieve sustainable development. This is because women perform four basic functions in the rural environment: a) productive, such as owners of an economic activity, salaried workers and family helpers (invisible for statistical and economic purposes); b) social, being responsible for the maintenance of the family unit and the care and well-being of the dependent population; c) cultural, by preserving and transmitting a multitude of cultural traditions (gastronomy, crafts and folklore, among others); and d) environmental. In this function they carry out very different activities, depending on whether or not they own land. In general terms, they all carry out the management of natural resources (land, water, forests,...), through the care of their gardens, adjacent common areas, and management of their environment. In addition, they take care of plant and animal species, promoting their conservation and biodiversity. And they participate in the education and environmental awareness of the younger generations and those who visit them (rural tourism), since they recognize the importance of environmental conservation. If they own land and exploit it directly, they carry out sustainable agriculture and livestock practices; because they know plants, natural cycles and biodiversity very well. In this sense, they develop sustainable agriculture, as they conserve traditional seeds, diversify crops, optimize natural resources, use environmentally friendly agricultural practices, and promote organic farming; which helps improve food security and reduce desertification. Likewise, these women promote the use of renewable energy (wind and solar) in their communities and business activities, the reduction of waste, the reuse of materials and the proper management of water, reducing the areas that suffer from drought and the negative effects of this. Due to their important role in the rural environment, and in the environmental function, it is important to promote the rights of women over the lands they own, mitigating patriarchal influence (if it exists), so that they develop the activities that best suit them. they are interested in, or in which they can provide greater added value due to the specific and differential knowledge they have, creating and managing their own businesses. On the other hand, it is necessary to recognize their role in the farms that they run, since on many occasions they are represented by their partners, siblings or parents in cooperatives, alhóndigas, banks or in other commercial transactions, leaving them partially invisible. To achieve this, her empowerment and official recognition is essential, through the Ownership of her business, and in the case of sharing it, obtaining Shared Ownership of her exploitation, which has little presence in the Region of Murcia (where there is only one woman who has it: Adela García Armero). Finally, women who provide family help on rural family farms must be made visible and recognized (with an employment contract, social security, payroll, professional career) and the rights that their condition provides them (retirement pensions, treatment of occupational diseases). , etc.).",14,102
Naval students develop an energy generator that uses the movement of waves to generate electricity,"Four UPCT Naval and Ocean Engineering students have developed the prototype of an energy generator that uses the movement of waves to power the ship's auxiliary systems. It is a sustainable device, from an environmental point of view. It is also portable and can be used on all types of boats, especially sailboats, fishing boats and freighters. The device, called Energy-Wave, is shaped like a torpedo with an internal propeller that extracts energy from the waves to produce electric current and supplies the auxiliary electrical systems of the boats. The students Ángel Martínez, Nayla Expósito, David Martínez and Alejandro Mañas point out that it is an ecological generator, since the ecological impact is almost zero. The system saves fuel burning. Regarding the carbon footprint, the device reduces fuel burning by 0.8 liters per hour. Therefore, it saves the equivalent of the energy needed to power a family's home for half a day. Energy-Wave designers point out the economic viability of the prototype. They estimate its cost at around 3,500 euros. It pays for itself in the first 300 days of use. The project has been mentored by Professor Aurora Martínez, from the Department of Business Economics.

How will the arrival of 5G impact our lives? Professor David Sánchez responds in The Adventure of Knowledge,"UPCT professor David Sánchez has participated in the scientific dissemination series “Sustainable Universe”, within TVE's “The Adventure of Knowledge”, in the chapter titled How will the arrival of 5G impact our lives, broadcast this Wednesday in RTVE's 2. Sánchez is the founder of EMITE, the first spin-off of the UPCT and currently with its own headquarters and in which it participates. 5G technology has reshaped the world as we knew it. In this context, David Sánchez Hernández, professor and researcher in the R&D group of the Department of Information and Communications Technologies at the UPCT, highlights that 5G technology contains three major and main improvements: Firstly, the interconnection of millions of elements, which has enabled the Internet of Things, so that there can be sensors that communicate and interconnect with all the others. Secondly, it increases data transmission and reception speeds of several Gbps per user, enabling a virtual immersion never before experienced. And as a third benefit, ultra-fast connections have enabled driverless vehicles or long-distance telematics operations. The EMITE Engineering company and the Polytechnic University of Cartagena created the 5G Lab Business Chair in 2018, which supports the first 5G Airborne Test and Measurement (OTA) laboratory in Spain, which EMITE has installed in the Region of Murcia . At EMITE they design, develop, manufacture and market complex test and measurement systems that allow evaluating the behavior of a wireless terminal, such as a mobile phone, or a television, at all stages of a product. For David Sánchez, measurement systems measure are today on all continents, in operators, manufacturers, evaluation rooms, universities and in the most important companies in the sector, such as Samsung, Huawei, Panasonic, Microsoft, Qualcomm, AT&T, Vodafone, Verizon, DoCoMo, among others. “We like to say that there is a little bit of Murcian technology in every mobile device we use,” he clarifies. Among the achievements obtained so far, David Sánchez clarifies that there are only five companies in the world like EMITE, and of them only three have the most complex accreditation in the United States to evaluate 5G technology, and this is one of the three. “When NASA called one day, we treated it like another client, and when ESA, the European Space Agency, proposed to us to work on a project to locate space debris using the MIMO technique, typical of 5G technology, we did nothing different. to what we were doing for the only Spanish mobile phone manufacturer,” he points out. ""When they told us - he adds - that it could not be measured at 220 GHz, that only the Chinese did that, we convinced the most advanced German laboratory to work with us, and today there is a second system measuring at 220 GHz, but in Europe, not in China.” David Sánchez has participated in this “The Adventure of Knowledge” program together with Iris Celorrio, from UDIMA, a private distance learning university in Madrid; Juan Carlos López, from the University of Castilla-La Mancha; Carlos J. Escudero, from the University of Coruña; and Luis Muñoz, on behalf of the University of Cantabria.

Agronomists researchers visit denitrifying bioreactors and wetlands in Illinois,"Researchers from the UPCT School of Agricultural Engineering are in Illinois (USA) visiting denitrifying bioreactors and wetlands. During their stay at the Department of Crop Sciences at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, the professor of Soil Science, José Álvarez Rogel, and Nazaret González Alcaraz, Ramón y Cajal researcher, will exchange experiences and discuss the application of the technologies included in the so-called “Solutions”. Based on Nature” to help alleviate the negative effects that agrochemicals applied in agriculture can cause on groundwater and surface water. The UPCT researchers are carrying out their visit with the team of Laura Christianson, one of the world's leading experts in denitrifying bioreactors, in which the researcher Carolina Díaz García, PhD in Engineering and Master from the UPCT, works as “Project Manager”. . Díaz completed his theses at the UPCT. His research focused on the application of wood chip bioreactors in the Campo de Cartagena for the denitrification of brines originated after the desalination of well water from the Quaternary aquifer and surface saline waters from the D7 canal. Álvarez recalls that the construction of denitrifying bioreactors and green filters is part of the actions of the so-called “Green Belt of the Mar Menor” that has been designed by the Ministry of Ecological Transition to help alleviate the impacts of agricultural effluents in the Mar Menor. For its part, the Autonomous Community is building denitrifying bioreactors to treat the water from the Rambla del Albujón. The application of these technologies in the Cartagena-Mar Menor Field “is promising, but still requires a lot of research for its optimization, since the factors, for example, the water to be treated, the substrates to be used, the retention times, and environmental conditions that influence their performance, such as temperatures, are very different from those in the US, where they have been working for years thanks to the fact that there are many more resources available to researchers and there is more awareness about the benefits that these systems provide. ”, adds Professor Álvarez Rogel.",6,13

"Beatriz Miguel: «Internationalization strengthens the development of the university, offers new possibilities, breaks down borders»","“Internationalization strengthens the development of the university, offers new possibilities, breaks down borders.” This was stated by the rector of the Polytechnic University of Cartagena, Beatriz Miguel, at the conference “Promoting the internationalization of the Spanish University”, held today in Madrid. The highest academic authority of the UPCT has highlighted that the internationalization of the Spanish University must be inclusive; It must also strengthen the development of the university and offer new possibilities. It is a challenge in constant evolution that requires dynamic responses and requires more adequate financing, according to Beatriz Miguel. At the conference, the report The challenge of internationalization of the Spanish university was presented. Purchased analysis and proposals, study prepared jointly by the Chamber of Spain, the Conference of Social Councils, and the CYD Foundation; to diagnose the current situation, in terms of internationalization, of the Spanish University System. Proposals to be developed by public bodies The report divides the battery of proposals to be developed between the Administration and the universities themselves. Regarding public bodies, the need to establish a specific governance system that includes and coordinates all the agents involved, mainly Autonomous Communities, Central Government and Crue Spanish Universities, is highlighted. In addition, it suggests the need to improve coordination between educational, immigration and employment policies and align objectives between ministries and companies. In this sense, it is committed to evaluating the establishment of a state agency that officially represents the Spanish University System (SUE) and its universities abroad, to promote access to information and advice and promote the international exchange of students, teachers and researchers. It is also committed to developing a strategy to promote the 'Spain brand' at the university education level; design and implement specific financial aid instruments for foreign students; promote mobility models and programs with regions of interest. Success factors of universities The success factors in the internationalization of universities have also been analyzed. These include having a comprehensive national strategy that allows taking advantage of interconnections and synergies; as well as the need for a connection between Autonomous Communities and the ministry, or digitalization as a tool for 'attracting' international students. Among the “recommendations” for university institutions, the attraction of international experts is highlighted, betting on a solid network of 'alumni' as an instrument in brand promotion, or promoting inclusive internationalization. To address the priorities mentioned in the report, as highlighted at the meeting, we must promote the modernization of governance in universities, underline the dynamic role of the university in society and advance multi-year financial plans. At the discussion table, in addition to the rector Beatriz Miguel; Segundo Píriz, rector UNIE (University of Planeta Training and Universities;) Markus González, undersecretary of Universities of the Ministry of Universities; and Pilar Villacorta, director of Relations with Universities at IBM Spain.

"Professor Natalia Carbajosa participates in a TVE documentary about ""The Waste Land"", by Eliot","The professor of the area of English Philology at the UPCT of the Polytechnic University of Cartagena, Natalia Carbajosa Palmero, in addition to being a poet and translator, has participated in the documentary about ""The Waste Land"" by TS Eliot, within the programming of the National University a Distancia, UNED, broadcast this Saturday on RTVE's La 2, and which is available on the website of this university's channel. “The Waste Land” is the modern poem par excellence and its author, TS Eliot, is recognized as one of the great poets of the 20th century. Natalia Carbajosa is the author of her most recent translation, published in Cátedra Letras Universales in 2022, in an edition by Viorica Patea and with the collaboration of María Teresa Gibert. According to Natalia Carbajosa, the five parts of The Waste Land do not have a logical connection between them, even within each part what is found are fragments lacking a plot thread between them. “It can be conceived as if it were a stage poem and throughout this stage a series of characters appear, without prior notice, who claim their part and disappear again; sometimes they are not even characters, we find shadows or voices; and other times, they are recognizable. The most striking is Divinity Tiresias, which comes from classical and mythological literature, which is a synthesis of all the others. “Other characters have transcended, such as the Phoenician Sailor, Madame Sosostris, the fortune teller or the typist, none of them are clearly defined. They have at the same time contemporary and classic or mythological features. What unites these characters is their lack of apparent connection, voices that have lost their reference and, furthermore, the fusion of East and West that is constantly reflected in the work is not explicitly given,” he highlights. In conclusion, Carbajosa adds that it is an epic from the 20th century that reaches our modern time. “What defines us now is fragmentation and fragmentation is a main characteristic and defining feature of The Waste Land.” Along with Natalia Carbajosa, Dídac Llorens Cubedo and Ana I. Zamorano Rueda participated, both representing the UNED; Fabio L. Vericat, from the UCM; and Viorica Patea, from the University of Salamanca. Natalia Carbajosa was awarded for the translation of the bilingual edition of the American poet Lorine Niedecker (1903-1970) 'And the place was water' (León: Eolas Ediciones 2018). The award has been awarded ex aequo together with the translation of Frankenstein of 1918, carried out by Margarita Carretero, from the University of Granada. The UPCT professor has obtained various recognitions, among which her children's book 'The Adventures of Perico Pico' stands out, awarded in 2017 at the Latin Book Awards 'Latino Book Awards' in the United States.",6,15
Students post their learning activity on TikTok,"TikTok comes to the UPCT classrooms. Business Administration and Management students have begun to use TikTok in their theoretical classes to delve into the syllabus of the Labor Law subject. Students publish videos on their TikTok account in which they explain legal concepts, in a practical way, such as “payroll”, “dismissal”, “occupational illness”, “salary” or “work accident”, among others. The UPCT is one of the few Spanish universities that uses this tool with its students. This experimental initiative is part of a UPCT teaching innovation project developed by the Professor of Labor and Social Security Law, Djamil Tony Kahale Carrillo. The teacher uses TikTok as an active learning tool. Stimulates creativity, curiosity and promotes learning in an entertaining way. The experience is turning out to be positive, both for the teachers and the students. Among the advantages of using this digital resource is the motivation of students, who are very familiar with this social network. “Initially we thought that the teachers were going to make the videos. We discarded it thinking that it is young people who should be the protagonists of their learning through tools that they use every day,” adds Prof. Kahale. UPCT is one of the first Spanish universities to incorporate TikTok into its educational activity. Some samples of the Tiktok made by the students can be seen on Prof. Kahale's YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JI6m-XtBdQY This social network allows you to create fun videos in a simple way without having great knowledge of editing and, almost always, with music. This project has been presented at the II International Congress “Education 4.0: Current issues on university teaching”, held this month at the Faculty of Business Sciences of the UPCT; in which more than 170 people have registered. In this scientific meeting, prominent speakers have shown an interdisciplinary vision on Technological Innovation; Artificial intelligence; teaching innovation in different disciplines, among other topics. This Congress (22197/OC/23) has been financed by the Ministry of the Environment, Mar Menor, Universities and Research, through the Séneca Foundation-Science and Technology Agency of the Region of Murcia under the Regional Mobility Program , Collaboration and Knowledge Exchange “Jiménez de la Espada”.",4,154
Awarded to the student who invented a low-cost wireless equipment for fencing,"First-year Architecture student at UPCT, Jaime Ayala Poveda has won the second Don Bosco National Award 2023, the 36th edition of this youth innovation and research contest, with his prototype of wireless equipment for fencing competitions. The system designed by Ayala and which he is developing with the help of the Fencing Federation of the Region of Murcia saves 40 meters of cable per fencer. Fencing weapons have a sensor that sends a signal after each touch to the opponent. Until now, the transmission is carried out through cables that run along the blade of the swords, sabers and foils, through the fencers' suits and reach the bottom of the court and, from there, to the electronic scoreboard. A system that gives rise to technical failures, when a cable breaks, and that complicates the mobility of athletes. “In a national tournament in Almería I got involved with the cable and fell,” recalls the young inventor, who won silver in the ranking of fencers in the Region of Murcia and gold among those under 20 years of age in his last competition. The alternative is the system that has been developed with radio frequency technology to wirelessly connect the weapons sensors with the marker. “We have tested it experimentally in the club's facilities and we have seen that it works,” says the student from the Polytechnic of Cartagena. “There are other alternatives on the market, but they are inaccessible to most clubs, so our equipment is low-cost to make it more affordable,” he adds. He developed the invention during his Research Baccalaureate at the IES Floridablanca and presented it at the IDIES congress with which the UPCT collaborates. “Researching to improve my sport is very satisfying,” acknowledges the student, who had to train in programming to complete his prototype. Despite this, he did not hesitate to enroll in the degree in Fundamentals of Architecture, his vocation since he was a child.",17,98
Experts affirm that financial culture can help improve the competitiveness of SMEs,"“Further development of financial culture in SMEs (small and medium-sized businesses) can help in times of uncertainty to reduce financial restrictions and facilitate access to financing under better financial conditions.” It is one of the conclusions of the meeting “Financial culture can help improve the competitiveness of SMEs”, held this Thursday at the Faculty of Business Sciences of the UPCT. Experts have highlighted that financial culture represents the level of knowledge, skills, attitudes and behavior that an entrepreneur or an SME owner or manager must have to make effective financial decisions to start a business, manage it and, ultimately, guarantee its sustainability and growth.” This debate table, organized by the Spanish Association of Accounting and Business Administration (AECA) and the Polytechnic University of Cartagena, has been organized on the occasion of the latest national study published by the Association “Financial Culture in SMEs”. This is a relevant report for the Spanish economy since it is a fundamental diagnostic and governance tool for managers and directors of SMEs, as well as for those responsible for public policies. Pedro Rivero, vice president of AECA (Spanish Association of Accounting and Business Administration), participated in this event; Ana Correa, president of COEC; Ramón Madrid, dean of the College of Economists of the Region of Murcia; Juan Jesús Lozano, from Caixabank; and the UPCT professors, Domingo García Pérez de Lema and Antonio Duréndez Gómez-Guillamón. Also attending on behalf of the UPCT were Juan Franciso Sánchez, vice-rector of Economy, Business and Entrepreneurship, and Ángel Rafael Martínez, dean of the Faculty of Business Sciences of the UPCT.",16,135
An underwater robot will record images of the ocean floor in various points in the Region chosen by high school students,"Students from five secondary schools in the Region have selected a series of coordinates in which an underwater robot will submerge to record images of the ocean floor. This immersion will be the culmination of the UPCT project 'Oceanographic Citizen Observatory' (OCO), a citizen science initiative that aims to bring the ocean closer to the population, especially educational centers, and raise awareness about the importance of protecting and conserving the marine environment. The five institutes that have participated in the project are the IES Felipe II, in Mazarrón; the IES Antonio Menárguez Costa, from Los Alcázares; and the IES Mediterráneo, Ben Arabí and San Isidoro, in Cartagena. The person in charge is the UPCT professor Francisco López Castejón, who has given the talk 'The seven wonders of the coast of the Region of Murcia' in each of the centers. At the end of the activity, he invited the students to choose a point on the regional coast, which has been chosen from the Mazarrón area to La Manga. Over the next few weeks, project coordinators will travel to different locations to record images of the ocean floor with the robot. In this way, students will have the opportunity to see all the biodiversity that exists in the areas that they have chosen, and they will even be able to use that information to carry out work for the institute. The UPCT, CORI (Cartagena Oceanographic Research Institute), and the Hespérides and Politécnico de Cartagena Vocational Training centers have jointly participated in the OCO project, in addition to the five institutes mentioned above. The initiative has the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Science and Technology – Ministry of Science and Innovation. Throughout the course, OCO has been divided into two actions. The first was the development and installation, with the help of Vocational Training students, of an underwater station in the Port of Cartagena, composed of a camera that broadcast images of the seabed live and open 24 hours a day for three weeks. The second action has been this citizen science initiative with the five institutes, which will end with the immersion of the underwater robot, scheduled for this month.",14,142
Almost fifty volunteers support students taking the EBAU exams,"The almost 50 volunteers supporting the University entrance exams, EBAU, which are held in Cartagena in the months of June and July, are deployed in three university locations: The Higher Technical School of Telecommunications Engineering (ETSIT) , the Higher Technical School of Industrial Engineering (ETSII), located on the Muralla del Mar campus; and the Faculty of Sports Sciences in San Javier, of the University of Murcia, but coordinated by the UPCT. This university volunteering, organized by the Vice-Rector for Students, Culture and Sports, has the following tasks: Assist the meeting groups to locate and organize the students and ensure that groups or large groups do not form. Also, accompany the group to the classroom, as support from the teachers who will be in charge of the groups. In addition, they must be available in the hallways and doors of the classrooms, in case any support to the teaching staff is necessary. Any student or member of the university community can volunteer at UPCT and it can be: in-person, online, or blended. Volunteer activities are offered throughout the academic year, and can go by their own code, depending on the number of hours, or the hours can be added and at the end of the course they are calculated depending on the type of activity. There are availability of options and compatibility between them. There are volunteer activities in social entities, in which students can support students with disabilities; Seed Project activities; actions to support the Volunteer Unit; and/or collaborations with UPCT Centers on their own projects, related to solidarity and diversity.

Microplastics in the water we drink and the air we breathe?,"What we breathe, what we eat, what we drink. Through these three actions we can deliver microplastics to our body. The world is flooded with plastic, according to experts. This June 5, World Environment Day, the United Nations focuses on solutions to plastic pollution through the #NoPlasticContamination campaign. Researchers from universities and research centers focus their efforts in this field. At UPCT, Javier Bayo, a researcher in the Environmental Engineering group, participates in several studies focused on the search for microplastics in drinking water and in the air we breathe. The professor maintains that tap water also contains microplastics, but that it is completely safe throughout the country. According to the data, Cartagena is the city in Spain with the lowest average values. “In the Region of Murcia, all water treatment plants provide drinking water of the highest quality,” points out Bayo, Eut+ coordinator for International Networks and Global Development. The professor recalls that in recent years, studies that try to find out to what extent we are in contact with these plastic microparticles have multiplied. One of the most notable has been published in the journal Water Research, in which Spanish scientists from several universities, such as the UPCT, and CSIC research centers that are part of EnviroPlaNet, Thematic Network of Micro and Nanoplastics in the Environment, have collaborated on a work that analyzes the microplastics that can be found in the water network of six cities on the peninsula (Madrid, Barcelona, Vigo, A Coruña, Murcia and Cartagena) and two in the Canary Islands (San Cristóbal de La Laguna and The Gran Canarian palms). In the airway On the other hand, Javier Bayo has participated in a research carried out at the General University Hospital of Elche, carried out by the UPCT and the Autonomous University of Madrid, in which microplastics have been discovered for the first time in the lower airway. of pulmonary patients. The research has been published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials, one of the most prominent international journals in the field of pollution. The authors of this study warn of this public health problem and recommend avoiding single-use plastics as much as possible; ventilate interior spaces; use respiratory protection systems in certain work environments; as well as not smoking, as preventive measures. They also suggest promoting the reduction of road traffic in cities, since the wear of vehicle tires generates many of the microplastics present in urban air.",6,48

Agronomists researchers test a biodegradable and compostable plastic to preserve fourth-range foods,"The magazine Hortícolae publishes the first results of this alternative material of plant origin designed for distribution in 'kilometer 0' For a planet #WithoutPlasticContamination. It is the motto of World Environment Day 2023. Researchers from the Polytechnic University of Cartagena (UPCT) are working in this direction, testing a compostable and biodegradable plastic. This is an alternative to conventional plastics that are used to package and preserve fourth-range products, that is, those sold ready to eat, such as salads. For example. The international journal Hortícolae has published the first results. The tests are carried out with a plastic made with polylactic acid (PLA), from corn and sugar cane starch. Food safety is guaranteed. Researchers have proven that no plastic particles are transferred to food. It will be very beneficial for the environment, in the opinion of Professor Juan Fernández, principal researcher of the Mediterranean Hortofloriculture group. “Through an industrial process it can be degraded quickly. On the other hand, conventional plastic takes between 100 and 1,000 years,” he points out. The tests, which are carried out on the Tomás Ferro farm and in the laboratories of the Institute of Plant Biotechnology (IBV), show that the products can now be preserved in optimal conditions for seven days. Now, researchers are testing whether the post-harvest shelf life is comparable to the plastics currently used. This sustainable alternative is designed for distribution in a short chain, at 'kilometer zero', that is, to be destined for urban and peri-urban production and marketing in urban restaurants and supermarkets. This project, called 'Innovative urban agriculture for sustainable production-IRRUPTION' (PID2020-114410RB-I00), is coordinated by researchers from the School of Agronomic Engineering Juan Fernández and Jesús Ochoa, Catalina Egea also participates; Perla Gómez, IBV researcher; Angelo Signore, professor at the University of Bari; Victor M.

Professor Ferrández Vicente will coordinate the National Network on artificial intelligence for neuroscience and mental health,"The UPCT Electronic Design and Signal Treatment Techniques research group, led by José Manuel Ferrández, will coordinate the National Network on Artificial Intelligence for neuroscience and mental health starting this June 1. Researchers will pool their resources and knowledge to develop new techniques for diagnosing and treating neuronal dysfunctions and mental disorders. The Network's researchers will focus their work on cases related to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, frontotemporal dementia, stroke, autism, Parkinson's or multiple sclerosis, among others. The network project, made up of 14 universities and companies, is committed to affective computing, which is related to emotions. Research in this field combines Engineering with Psychology, Cognitive Sciences, Neuroscience, Sociology and Education. José Manuel Ferrández points out that now, “the key technologies for emotional improvement are virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and social robots (RS), which are technologies that have attracted the attention of rehabilitation researchers. due to the enormous possibilities they offer to simulate environments in which to recover lost skills.” The Network's researchers plan to promote a platform where protocols, data, and algorithms are exchanged to improve efficiency, transparency, and explainability. According to Ferrández, they will mainly deal with explainability, ensuring that everything developed by artificial intelligence is explainable and ethical, says Ferrández, who works in AI ethics. The network hopes to attract new vocations and doctoral students in this line of research. It will meet for the first time at the IWNAC conference, which will be held in 2024 in Portugal.

" doctoral thesis from the Cajamar-UPCT Chair, awarded at the Congress of Researchers in Social and Cooperative Economy","The researcher Jorge Luis Sánchez Navarro, associate professor in the area of Economics, Sociology and Agrarian Policy at the UPCT, has received the first CIRIEC (International Research and Information Center on Public, Social and Cooperative Economy) prize for his doctoral thesis entitled “ Analysis of opportunism in the field of agri-food cooperatives”, carried out at the Cajamar Chair of Agri-Food Cooperatives of the UPCT, and awarded by the Scientific Committee of the XIX Congress of Researchers in Social and Cooperative Economy. As explained by Jorge Luis Sánchez, in the context of compliance with the standards and requirements of sustainable development, membership in an agri-food cooperative reduces the external opportunism that agricultural producers face, both that which comes from input suppliers and from the agents who constitute the first link in the marketing of their products. The thesis has also highlighted that the singularities of cooperatives lead to the appearance of opportunistic behaviors among their members (internal opportunism), both in the case of first-level and second-level cooperatives, and identifies the factors that favor them and the reduce, as well as the government mechanisms to control them in each type of cooperative. The winner has pointed out the importance and usefulness of the results for those responsible for agri-food cooperatives: “on the one hand, because they reinforce the prominence of these organizations by highlighting one more advantage they have for their members. And, on the other hand, because they help them design and implement mechanisms to manage the internal opportunism of the partners.” The doctoral thesis, defended by Jorge Luis Sánchez in November 2022 at the UPCT, received the highest qualification, 'cum laude', and the mention of European doctorate. The tribunal was made up of Juan Francisco Juliá Igual, professor at the Polytechnic University of Valencia; Francisco José Alcón Provencio, professor at UPCT, and Shayergheh Ashourizadeh, professor at Wageningen University (Netherlands). The thesis has been directed by doctors Narciso Arcas Lario, director of the Cajamar Chair of Agri-Food Cooperativism at the Polytechnic University of Cartagena, and Miguel Hernández Espallardo, from the University of Murcia.",2,11

Specifically, those who wish to participate must solve some of the goals established in sustainable development goal 11: SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND COMMUNITIES. The challenge must see how telecommunications are integrated or help achieve these objectives/goals, and a prototype must be developed based on any programmable platform with the Arduino IDE with which this relationship is revealed, for example, through a 5G communications system, LoRaWAN, WiFi, Bluetooth, etc. The teams must present and defend the system chosen and developed before a university tribunal, explaining not only the design of the prototype but also how they have integrated telecommunications to achieve the stated objective. For the individual test, the resolution of a set of problems related, directly or indirectly, to Telecommunications Engineering will be proposed. To do this, participants must demonstrate an ingenious use of fundamental physical-mathematical tools, acquired throughout their ESO in their Science itinerary. The national event is organized by the Official College of Telecommunications Technical Engineers (COITT) and the Spanish Association of Graduates & Technical Telecommunications Engineers (AEGITT), together with the Conference of Directors of Schools with Engineering Degrees in the Field of Telecommunications (CODIGAT), which brings together around twenty university schools as sponsors and collaborators.

"The UPCT, third place with studies with the most job opportunities in the ranking of the BBVA Foundation and the Ivie","The Polytechnic University of Cartagena, UPCT, occupies third place according to the U-ranking study carried out by the BBVA Foundation and the Ivie (Valencian Institute of Economic Research) based on a list of the one hundred universities with the best degree of job insertion. The first place is occupied by the Polytechnic University of Madrid, and in second place, the Catholic University of Santa Teresa de Jesús de Ávila. This ranking is prepared with 2019 data on graduates five years earlier; The first places are occupied by the public Polytechnic Universities and some private universities located around Madrid. All of them include computer science and engineering studies in their programs. In addition to the degree, a key factor of employability is the chosen university. It is confirmed that Medicine, Computer Science, Engineering and Health are the studies that offer the best results in job placement, and among engineering, they stand out from Aeronautics and computers to Telecommunications, Electronics and Software Development. Spain has an unemployment rate of around 13%, double that of the EU, and unemployment among those under 25 years of age that shoots up to almost 30%. Despite these data, there are careers whose employability is practically guaranteed. These degrees also have a percentage close to 100% of employees, earning 1,500 euros net or more per month, as is the case in Medicine. The great novelty of the 2023 report is that U-Ranking creates a tool to compare the results in job placement of different studies and universities; in addition to an approximation of the salary they would earn, so they have classified the degrees based on the percentage of those employed in that field who earn 1,500 euros or more per month. Regarding the careers with the best job opportunities, among the more than 4,000 existing degrees in Spain, the report has organized them into 101 areas, focusing on four indicators: the employment rate five years after graduating; if the monthly income is greater than or equal to 1,500 euros net; if they work in a job that requires a university degree; and if the work corresponds to the studies completed. Medicine is at the top of this index, with an employment rate of 95%, 91.8% of employees earning 1,500 or more euros per month and practically 100% of graduates working in highly qualified occupations and activities. directly related to their studies.",8,65

Among the speakers are the professor of the University of Murcia, Francisco Javier Corbalán; the professor of Geography and History of the IES Eduardo Janeiro, from Malaga, Rosa Liarte; the professor of Educational Technology at the University of Murcia, Mari Paz Prendes; and the director of the CEA Infante de Murcia, María Rodríguez. The psychologist and professor at the University of Murcia Francisco Javier Corbalán, “an eminence in cognitive evaluation of creativity”, according to Fernando Cerdán, and author of the CREA test; appreciation of creative intelligence through a cognitive evaluation of individual creativity. It is a very useful instrument because it combines various qualities highly demanded by professionals: validity, brevity and objectivity. Corbalán highlights that “when faced with the question of whether creativity is an evaluable dimension, capable of being measured and compared between different people, the scientific answer is complex. It is not a variable of ratio, but of order, and has very special characteristics; But the answer is that, not only can, but must evaluate the creative potential of people, particularly in their learning stage.” He adds that “it is important to highlight that said potential is a psychological variable, while creative achievements depend not only on potential, but also on opportunities, knowledge, work carried out, etc. And one of the dimensions on which a lot can depend is whether that person's creative potential was detected at the time, or whether it was not paid attention to, was discarded, or was confused with some personality or behavioral disorder.” . It concludes that the cognitive evaluation of creativity represents a great challenge and an urgent need for 21st century education. The presentation by the Geography and History teacher at IES Eduardo Janeiro, from Malaga, Rosa Liarte, focused on the use of digital tools to promote creativity. According to Fernando Cerdán, she is “an innovative communicator in her IES due to the use of mobile phones and ICT in her classes.” For Rosa Liarte, “in the 21st century it is essential to see technology as a means for learning.” Rosa has reflected on the use of technology in the classroom, and has shown how through the flipped classroom, known as Flipped Classroom, she has been able to develop PBL projects with students using different educational applications. He has shown examples of projects in the Classroom, both in person and completely online. Likewise, Professor Mari Paz Prendes has pointed out that creativity is a fundamental capacity for personal, social and professional development. We must educate for creativity in schools and understand that creativity is closely associated with the capacity for innovation or problem solving by finding divergent and original answers. “Creative people are called to play a very important role in society and in the world of work in the 21st century.” For her part, María Rodríguez has made an exhibition of creativity activities carried out in the classroom by the students and teachers of CEA Infante, using the CREATIT project courses and a selection of collaborative techniques. More than 100 teachers from all educational stages attended the event. CREATIT is a project funded by the Erasmus+ program of the European Union that aims to strengthen the pedagogical practices of educators and promote creativity using ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) as well as the implementation of strategies collaborative in the educational field.",4,155

They study how vegetative covers improve the sustainability of hedge crops,"Traditional practices such as letting herbaceous forage plants grow between streets of trees, typical of many agricultural areas such as the orchard of Murcia, are now studied by UPCT researchers as a complement to sustainability, biodiversity and pest control in modern hedgerow farms. that optimize water, fertilizer and phytosanitary products. Two projects from the Ministry of Science and Innovation awarded to researchers from the School of Agronomists of the Polytechnic of Cartagena Raúl Zornoza and Lola Gómez study the efficiency of different types of covers, depending on whether they grow spontaneously or are planted and depending on their agricultural management. , whether mowed, provided as green manure, or folded, to achieve benefits such as reducing the use of machinery, improving soil health and water retention. “These environmental, productive and quality improvements are aligned with European objectives,” underlines Lola Gómez, highlighting that increasing the number of microorganisms in soils increases fertility and carbon sequestration to mitigate climate change. ""In this way we combine traditional practices with the most modern and efficient agriculture, such as hedgerow crops, in which productive walls of trees of no more than two meters obtain high harvests in less surface area, with lower production costs and greater optimization of fertilizer, water and phytosanitary products,” highlights the UPCT researcher. The researchers will study for four years the impact on farms compared to those where there is no green cover. The test farms are in the Region of Murcia, Andalusia, the Valencian Community and Castilla - La Mancha and they grow olive, almond, apple, pear and apricot trees.

The engineer adds: “We study very new things and we have the opportunity to explore and discover what we really like. And this approach makes it worth taking this master's degree at UPCT.”",8,68
The architects' 'factory' turns 15 and shows its talent,"The UPCT has qualified more than three hundred male and female architects, in an almost identical proportion, since fifteen years ago the studies that enable them to practice this profession that combines technical, artistic and humanistic knowledge were implemented in Cartagena. The Polytechnic commemorates the anniversary this year with a sample of the best final year projects carried out in the degree in Architecture. The exhibition '2008-2023: 15 years of Architecture at the UPCT', curated by professors María José Muñoz Mora and Fernando Miguel García Martín, has selected thirty Final Projects (TFE) from the degree in Architecture that obtained outstanding or with honors and also includes the professional career of its authors after training at the Polytechnic and the topics and places that the academic projects of the Higher Technical School of Architecture and Building (ETSAE) have addressed during these three decades. Thus, throughout the month of June you will be able to see projects proposed for different neighborhoods, councils and districts of Cartagena and Murcia, as well as for many other municipalities in the Region, such as La Unión, Los Alcázares, San Pedro del Pinatar, Ricote, Cehefín , Caravaca, Cieza, Jumilla or Totana, and also works located in other Spanish provinces. Among the works with the best academic grade is the first TFE in Architecture that was approved at the UPCT, in November 2014, that of Antonio Zamora Guillén: a center for agri-food synergies and research designed to use the abandoned monastery of San Ginés de the Jara. Also one of the first promotions is the work of David Hernández López, presented in 2015, designing a transport terminal for the AVE and a hypothetical tram in Cartagena. The project proposed burying the tracks that lead to the current train station and dissipating the division with the Los Mateos neighborhood. Among the first graduates with honors are some of those who have achieved numerous international distinctions, such as José María Mateo Torres and Tomás Lario Roca, members of the team of UPCT graduates who won the European biennial of young architects in 2021. Both, along with fellow graduate Marta Sánchez Pérez, won a prize from the international Design Against War competition, and Mateo Torres also won the IE School of Architecture & Design's prize in 2019. Likewise, the most recent graduates have also obtained awards, such as the one that Álvaro Sánchez Garda and Daniel Nicolás Pagán won in the Iberian Pladur Systems Competition. The academic work carried out at the School of Architecture and Building has achieved various awards, such as one of those included in the exhibition, the urban strategy proposal for Cehegín and other towns in the Northwest of the Region by Sergio Giménez Fernández, which won the College of Architects award in 2020. Vicente Rex Lario's TFE was also selected as one of the best in Spain in 2019. The exhibition will allow you to learn about projects created by UPCT students to solve problems of all kinds, not just architectural or urban planning, such as the design of the center for neuromuscular diseases in the Puerto de la Cadena de Alba Miró Andreu, the specialized center for epilepsy patients in La Arrixaca by Juan Jesús López León or the psychiatric hospital designed by Virginia Monreal Martínez, designed for the Ronda de Cieza promenade, next to the river and with views of the famous flowering peach trees. Another of the works that will be exhibited is located in this same Vega Media del Segura, the sports and agrotourism center project for the El Menjú farm by Elías Tudela Martínez. The oceanic posidonia dissemination center designed by Virginia Ruiz Guillamón for the Salinas regional park is one of the many projects that the Architecture students at the UPCT have proposed for the Mar Menor environment, such as that of Luis López Moya, titled 'New Eden. An earthly paradise on the coastal edge of San Pedro del Pinatar'. The academic works will be displayed in removable displays designed and manufactured by the students of the Projects III subject of the degree in Fundamentals of Architecture, which has replaced the previous degree in Architecture and which is complemented by the master's degree in Architecture to grant the professional qualification that is required. to practice the profession. The UPCT also offers the degree in Building Engineering (previously called Technical Architecture), the master's degrees in Architectural Heritage and in Building Science and Technology in Architecture and the new doctorate in Architecture, Heritage and the City.",8,36
Architecture students design and build removable displays of models and sheets,"Functionality and attractiveness. The students of the subject Projects III of the degree in Fundamentals of Architecture have faced this double requirement by designing and building, with low-cost materials, prototypes of removable displays of models and architectural sheets. After the individual design and construction exercise, the “prototype storm”, as defined by professors Pedro García Martínez and Antonio Cerezuela Motos, the students will work together on the execution of the final model, which will combine ideas from several of the proposals presented. “The students have created very diverse, functional exhibitors with inexpensive materials that have the capacity to generate an atmosphere in the interior exhibition space and that, at the same time, are attractive from the outside of the CIM,” explain the teachers of the subject. The removable structures will debut in June during the exhibition of the best final works of studies carried out by each of the classes of architects trained at the Higher Technical School of Architecture and Building, ETSAE, since the studies that enable them were implemented 15 years ago. to practice the architectural profession.",8,36
Architecture concludes designing youth and association centers to revitalize the center of Lorca,"Recovering an urban block, central but devoid of commercial life, is the objective of the final projects in Architecture carried out by students from the Polytechnic University of Cartagena for a location on Selgas Street in the old town. “It was known as 'the street of shops' and it had 24 businesses, none of which have survived,” explains José Francisco Abril Portillo in his Final Degree Project, who proposes a leisure, training and e-commerce center. youth integration that would be delimited by pre-existing facades. The designed space would have a sports area, including a skatepark, a climbing wall and high-rise slides, as well as a children's playground and exhibition and meeting areas, a stand and a small atrium, as well as offices, a cafeteria and a soup kitchen. Young people “need a space where they can be, a place to meet, spend time, ask for help, train, listen and be heard, a place to integrate and socialize,” explains the already UPCT architect in his project. The academic project, directed by professors Montserrat Solano and Antonio Cerezuela, also aims to be a place of support for the different associations of Lorca, which can use this space to improve and expand their services, as in the work of another UPCT student. to conclude his studies in Architecture: Carlos Barrero Nicolás. Barrero has designed a headquarters for the Lorca association fabric inspired by the landscape of Lorca and the proportions of its old town. Her final work was also directed by Solano and Cerezuela and is also located in this deteriorated area of the city of the Sun. Center for creative synergies On the other hand and also directed by professors Solano and Cerezuela, the work of Amanda Sarabia García proposes an equipment cultural to claim the importance that crafts have had throughout history in Lorca. “It will serve to attract new entrepreneurs who will promote their projects and new ways of working, so that, together, they create creative synergies,” explains the student. Their proposal is a center where introductory courses would be taught in the different artistic disciplines, both individually and collectively, and in which users could train and research independently, experiment, create, produce and develop as artists and future artists. businessmen. “A creation space where the most experienced in the craft world will teach young people traditional techniques and, on the other hand, young people will introduce older people to new technologies,” adds the architect graduated from the UPCT.",1,66
An architect from the UPCT directs the restoration of the Marchamalo salt flats that she proposed as a student,"An academic, ambitious and counter-current work, which is reflected in a project already underway with European funds. The architect Paloma de Andrés Ródenas concluded her studies at the Polytechnic University of Cartagena in 2018 with a final project in which she proposed recovering the salt mining activity of Marchamalo by promoting ecotourism and is now directing the restoration of rafts and ships acquired by ANSE that she is going to do the idea that he launched from the UPCT comes true. “The idea of the ANSE project is very similar to the one I proposed, restarting the salt mining activity in an artisanal way, promoting the ecosystem benefits beyond the economic income of salt as a product, which per surface area will be minimal, thus favoring the recovery of the biodiversity and cultural and sustainable tourism,” explains the young architect. The project already has an urban planning license from the Cartagena City Council to begin the restoration of two warehouses located in the eastern area of the Salinas de Marchamalo. “In one of them there will be an interpretation center and in the other there will be work spaces linked to the salt flats and the Mar Menor, research and offices,” advances the graduate of the UPCT School of Architecture and Building. This first intervention has a budget of 100,000 euros and is framed in the ANSE project for the Regeneration of salt flats and sandbanks in the Mar Menor (Resalar), which has 1.7 million European funds from the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan facilitated by the Biodiversity Foundation of the Ministry for the Ecological Transition. The architect is working together with environmental engineers and mining engineers to recover and put into operation the salt ponds, in which they also want to enable an area for mud baths as in other spaces in the Mar Menor.",8,68

Companies with greater financial flexibility better avoid unexpected economic crises,"Large companies that collapse are very dependent on external financial resources, concludes the UPCT doctoral thesis that has used big data tools to analyze and predict the economic-financial causes of business failure. “There has been a significant change in the processes of business failure before and after the crisis caused by Covid,” says José Noguera Venero, new doctor from the Polytechnic of Cartagena. “Companies with greater financial flexibility, which maintain surplus resources available in the short term, have had a greater probability of survival since the beginning of the pandemic, while before covid the companies with the highest probability of survival were those that had a more balanced financial system,” he highlights. The research, directed by Manuel Ruiz Marín and Mari Luz Maté Sánchez-Val within the PhD program in Economics at the UPCT, has also found significant patterns of geographical contagion in business failures, associated with companies with low financial flexibility and low capitalization. “The application of conservative financial practices to deal with unexpected external 'shocks' has taken on greater importance,” they say. “With greater financial flexibility, companies will be able to face situations of financial instability in the face of unexpected economic crises,” point out the researchers, who propose in this thesis a useful methodology for managers and directors with which the company's situation is identified based on of the values of the financial ratios. “This evaluation will allow us to anticipate financial situations that may put the survival of the company at risk,” they indicate.",14,135
"Miguel Linares, multi-award winning entrepreneurial student: «I started training thanks to Inno-EUt+»","The 'Startup meeting and demoday' event of the Inno-Eut+ project, an initiative aimed at universities of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT HEI initiative), held in February 2022 during the week of meetings in Cartagena of the European University of Technology, was the beginning of the entrepreneurial career, marked by multiple awards, of Miguel Linares, a student of the degree in Naval Architecture and Marine Systems Engineering at the UPCT. ""Since I discovered my vocation for entrepreneurship, I had read many books but I didn't really know where to start"", recalls the student from Almeria at the Polytechnic. ""The Inno-Eut+ course was just what I needed to know how to develop and present a business idea,"" he recalls. ""I loved it, it was spectacular"", he stressed that experience in which he was already distinguished, which allowed him to present his project to other entrepreneurs at the European University of Technology. He liked it so much that he convinced another classmate from the Naval School, Roberto Carlos García, to join him in the UPCT's Community of Resolvers (CORE) entrepreneurship program. Both won the first and second prizes in the 2022 call for applications. Their business project was already outlined by then: using Artificial Intelligence to optimize the electrical performance of renewable energy installations. ""I came up with it while monitoring engines during an internship in the navy,"" he says. ""After coming second in the CORE they contacted me from the European Business and Innovation Center (CEEIC) in Cartagena because they were interested in my Global Electric project and offered me to participate in the Smart Industry 5.0 programme"", he says of his penultimate training in entrepreneurship, in which ""I took my revenge on Roberto Carlos and this time I won"", he says jokingly about the award obtained in the category of best business model, financed by Repsol, which was presented to him in February. Linares does not miss out on the many opportunities for entrepreneurs at the UPCT and has also participated in this year's CORE challenge, a social impact hackathon to come up with entrepreneurial proposals to help extend services for people with disabilities. ""I learned a lot about the subject and it served me as teamwork practice to develop a solution against the clock,"" he says. ""It's very useful as professional training,"" she adds, noting how the successive trainings have helped her to progress in various transversal competencies. ""I wasn't very good at public speaking,"" he says. The student is currently focusing on completing his academic studies before turning his efforts to Global Electric. ""There are already customers interested in the opportunities to maximize the efficiency of photovoltaic installations by adapting consumption to the weather situation and in the advantages of using batteries only when necessary to extend their life span,"" he says.",14,79

Professor Jorge Eiroa directs a new archaeological excavation at the Castle of Lorca,"The Medieval History area of the University of Murcia, under the direction of Professor Jorge Eiroa, is carrying out a new archaeological excavation in the Castle of Lorca, in collaboration with the Municipal Archaeological Museum of the city, whose director, Andrés Martínez Rodriguez , director of the Municipal Archaeological Museum of Lorca and José Ángel González Ballesteros, coordinate the work with Eiroa. Since last November, the 'Archaeological excavation project in the Jewish quarter of the Castle of Lorca. '2023' campaign is underway, focused on House XVI and its surroundings. The main objective is to discover the treasures kept by the Jewish quarter of Lorca Castle, thus providing a more complete vision of the rich cultural diversity that has shaped our city over the centuries. Specifically, the work focuses on the excavation of spaces 22 and 33. The research will continue with an interdisciplinary study of historical, archaeological, archaeozoological, archaeobotanical, construction and conservation aspects, since both the structures and the materials and movable property will be analyzed. recovered. This new intervention, which continues after the last campaign carried out in 2020, has the participation of five qualified archaeologists, including Dr. Alicia Hernández Robles and predoctoral researcher María Isabel Molina Campuzano, who will address the interdisciplinary study of the structures, materials and recovered personal property; and Dr. Mireia Celma who will carry out her work as an archaeobiologist, managing carpological, anthracological and palynological sampling.

Members of the Basic and Applied Zoology to Management and Conservation group assert the multiple benefits that ponds and watering holes offer to terrestrial birds.,"Swallows, linnets, crows and a multitude of other birds come to livestock ponds to drink, bathe, feed and even collect mud to build their nests. This is one of the conclusions of the study carried out by a scientific team from the University of Murcia (UMU), the Miguel Hernández University (UMH) of Elche and the Complutense University of Madrid. The results suggest that small bodies of water associated with extensive livestock farming, such as water troughs and livestock ponds, play a crucial role in maintaining bird communities in agroforestry ecosystems. Up to 80 different species of birds use these water sources in the Region of Murcia. The study, published in the journal Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment, evaluates the benefits or ecological services that these small bodies of water offer for land birds that inhabit the environment. To do this, the team made up of six researchers carried out bird censuses in 39 ponds and watering holes distributed throughout different natural spaces in the Region of Murcia, covering a wide environmental gradient, from the most arid regions of the coast to the corners most humid areas in the northwest of Murcia. During the censuses, they recorded the species of birds that came to the ponds and watering holes, as well as the type of use that these animals made in the surroundings of the small bodies of water. In this way, they obtained information about what type of birds use the ponds and watering holes to obtain benefits and what type of benefits they obtain. Historically, the scientific community and a large part of society have recognized that these small aquatic ecosystems were important for birds because they provided water for drinking, an essential resource for wild animals to regulate their water balance, especially in semi-arid areas such as the southeast. Iberian. However, to date, an exhaustive evaluation of the specific benefits that wildlife obtain from these small bodies of water had not been carried out. Using field observations, the study identifies up to six important ecological functions that waterholes and ponds provide for terrestrial birds. Although the provision of drinking water was the predominant service, since 74% of the 13,637 birds observed went to the ponds and watering holes to drink, five other relevant ecological functions were recorded. One of these services was the provision of food to birds through emerging insects, such as mosquitoes, mayflies and dragonflies, whose larval phases are aquatic and develop in watering holes, but the adult phases are aerial. However, some birds of prey also went to small bodies of water in search of prey, taking advantage of the fact that multitudes of other smaller birds gather on the edge of the watering holes to quench their thirst. On the other hand, several of the recorded bird species also used the bodies of water to bathe (thus keeping their plumage in good condition), as well as to collect mud from the banks to build the nest, find shelter in the adjacent vegetation and even emit territorial songs or calls. The study also reveals that different groups of birds used the small bodies of water for different ecological functions. For example, the provision of emerging insects particularly benefited species such as swallows, swifts and bee-eaters, while the behavior of collecting mud with the beak to build the nest was mainly observed in swallows and corvids. However, the direct intake of water was a behavior common to most of the 80 species of birds associated with the watering holes, among which up to 15 species of high conservation interest were found (threatened at the national level or included in the Directive Birds). The researchers conclude that, despite the important role they play in Mediterranean landscapes, these small bodies of water are rapidly disappearing from our landscapes, mainly due to the alarming decline of extensive livestock farming and changes in land use derived from intensive irrigated agriculture. In this sense, the researcher and leader of the study José Manuel Zamora Marín, from the Department of Applied Biology of the UMH, highlights that currently there is no protection figure that guarantees the conservation of these water resources or their adequate management. Likewise, it highlights the need to implement management strategies that take into account the transcendental importance of these small bodies of water in the functioning of Mediterranean ecosystems. The field work was carried out within the framework of a predoctoral scholarship awarded to Zamora Marín by the University of Murcia (reference R-605/2016). The researcher currently has a postdoctoral fellowship funded by the Ministry of Science and Innovation of Spain and the European Union NextGeneration EU/PRTR (FJC2021-046923-I) that he is developing at the UMH.

"report from the Human Management Chair of the University of Murcia states that promoting business leadership, motivation and commitment reduces the absenteeism rate","The Human Management Chair of the University of Murcia, in collaboration with the University of Alicante, the Good Decisions Club (Alicante), Las Naves (Valencia), the Human Resources Club (Castellón) and Asepeyo, under the technical direction of Cegos, has presented the Report on Absenteeism at Work, in which more than 800 companies from the eastern Spanish area (Alicante, Castellón, Valencia and the Region of Murcia) have participated. This is a study that aims to analyze and predict parameters to improve productivity, loyalty and job satisfaction, “always with the intention of seeking solutions and taking into account people as a key factor in organizations,” in words of Pepa Jiménez, president of Human Direction. On a regional basis, the study shows that the absenteeism rate in the Region of Murcia stands at 6.4%, highlighting identification with the company as the main factor in reducing this figure. The study has also detected that the larger size of the company increases absenteeism, while it decreases in companies where there is greater contractual diversity and greater generational diversity in the workforce, lower turnover and in companies with a defined business structure. In this sense, the role of human resources management has been highlighted as key to achieving better business practices that help reduce absenteeism rates, promoting business leadership, motivation and commitment of workers through better management. by objectives, a development of internal training and better conciliation, as well as a salary policy in line with the market. Digitalization and adaptation to changes have also been exposed as factors that influence the degree of absenteeism, so that organizations that better adapt to changes and that have fluid internal communication have less impact on absenteeism. The general director of the Employment and Training Service (SEF), Marisa López Aragón, has highlighted the variables of absenteeism that affect the generation of employment and that limit the growth of companies, pointing out that “SMEs are more protected than large ones.” companies and that defined business structures with clear leadership are vital to reducing absenteeism, which is why human resources management is key to reducing absenteeism.” Next, the director of the Chair of Human Management and vice dean of the Faculty of Labor Sciences of the University of Murcia, Isabel Barba; has explained the methodology of the study in which more than 800 companies have participated, more than half of the Region of Murcia, and for which a sample of 240 model companies has been used. For his part, the director of Mercado Valencia and head of communication at Cegos, José Juan Aguilar, has presented the data that reflects the situation of absenteeism in the Levante area: “The drop in productivity, the delays or 'the great resignation' have a great impact on company results. With this study we not only seek to collect data, but also create a formula to predict absenteeism rates and find solutions.”",10,106

The areas in which volunteers can participate are as varied as Social Projects and Activities, such as school support and reinforcement for minors, leisure and free time activities, social accompaniment and activities with the elderly; collaboration in cultural, sports and promotion of healthy living activities; support in Education, libraries and Study Rooms; or participation in the Civil Protection Group, among others.",3,3
"For the third consecutive year, the UMU receives support from the “la Caixa” Foundation to help students in vulnerable situations","The University of Murcia (UMU) has received support from the “la Caixa” Foundation, through CaixaBank, with a financial contribution to help students who are in a situation of economic or social vulnerability in the 2023-24 academic year, with the objective that they can continue their university studies. Specifically, the UMU has received a collaboration of 10,000 euros. This is the third consecutive year that the “la Caixa” Foundation collaborates with the UMU, so in this three-year period it has collaborated with a total of 50,000 euros. This new aid will be managed by the UMU Social Care Office, a service that aims to promote equal opportunities among students, as well as eliminate economic and social barriers so that students can continue or complete their degree studies. master or doctorate. The office, located in the Social Center of the Espinardo Campus, addresses situations of social difficulty such as disability, dependency or mental illness. Since its launch, it has provided help to more than 500 people in the university community. More information at um.es/web/officinasocial. This amount is added to the contributions made by the UMU workers and departments themselves, as well as by the UMU Alumni Association (A4). Since its launch, the Social Care Office has also received financial contributions from the town councils of Alhama de Murcia, Archena, Beniel, Ceutí, Lorquí, Murcia, Santomera and Villanueva del Río Segura. Thanks to its territorial capillarity, the CaixaBank branch network, the largest in Spain with a presence in 2,200 municipalities, can detect local needs and support the ”la Caixa” Foundation in channeling financial aid aimed at social entities. In 2022, through CaixaBank offices, we helped promote 5,624 social projects from 5,041 entities.",8,5
"44.5 percent of family businesses increased their sales in 2023, increasing their problems in finding qualified personnel, according to the barometer of the UMU-UPCT Family Business Chair","The Barometer prepared annually by the Mare Nostrum University of Murcia-Polytechnic University of Cartagena Family Business Chair, with the collaboration of the Murcia Family Business Association (AMEFMUR) and the support of CaixaBank and the Cajamurcia Foundation, has been presented at the University of Murcia by the rector of the University of Murcia, José Luján; the rector of the Polytechnic University of Cartagena, Beatriz Miguel; the director of Caixa Bank in the Region of Murcia, Juan Jesús Lozano; the director of the Development Institute, Joaquín Gómez; and by the coordinator of the study and director of the Mare Nostrum UM-UPCT Family Business Chair, Ángel Meroño. Economic and business situation The global economic recovery remains slow and uneven, global growth is expected to slow to 3.0% in 2023 mainly due to inflationary tensions and war conflicts. However, labor markets in advanced economies maintain their dynamism, allowing unemployment rates to be intensely reduced. The Spanish economy closed the 2022 financial year with a GDP increase of 5.8%, exceeding the pre-pandemic level and making it one of the most dynamic countries within the EU. Despite the recovery in employment, it still has the highest unemployment rate in the EU. The Spanish economy is expected to grow above 2% in the current year and then slow down. The most recent growth forecasts for the regional economy confirm a considerable slowdown in the pace of growth compared to the previous year. Thus, real GDP growth in the Region of Murcia is expected to be around 1.8% in 2023. The companies surveyed, during September and October, improve their opinion on the economic situation in 2023 above the expectations expressed ago. one year. Regarding the business situation, all variables present positive balances, except exports. The greatest increase occurs in the Investments variable, even when expectations were negative. More than 36% of family businesses have increased their investments this year. The performance of sales also stands out, 44.5% of companies have increased their turnover during 2023, also above the expected figures. However, even with positive balances, employment has worsened slightly. Even so, companies that have maintained (60%) or increased (24.5%) their number of workers predominate. The Confidence Index of Family Businesses in the Region of Murcia stands at 10.6 with a growth of 9.6 points, both due to the improvement in results and expectations, especially in sales and investments. Strategy and concerns When it comes to competing, family businesses continue to focus mainly on offering service; in this sense, 72% are committed to quality. Next in importance is efficiency through cost control and a growing interest in achieving organizational improvements. Sales orientation consolidates third place at the expense of diversification orientation. Regarding concerns during 2023, the shortage of qualified personnel is confirmed as the main problem, as declared by 62% of companies, which represents an increase of 16 points compared to 2022. The weakness of demand (40%) with a decrease of 3 points is in second place. Even though the concern is less present, it is worth highlighting a growth of 180% due to capacity, currently affecting 14% of companies. For 2024, the external factors of most concern are, first of all, the legal framework (7% of mentions). Next in importance is the availability of qualified personnel and confidence in the economy. Regarding the business model, firstly, in 7% of the mentions, the concern for cost control follows; Next in importance is the family issue, specifically generational transmission. Family dimension Regarding the objectives of family businesses, reputation occupies first place (8.3 out of 10), second place is occupied by the involvement of the owner family (7.4), then survival (7 .3), followed by financial independence (7.2). Regarding corporate governance, the option of not making changes continues to be the majority (71%) and its importance increases from the second generation onwards. 12% of companies plan to pass the company on to the next generation, assuming a drop of 10 points. 13% consider selling the company, with 21% in first generation companies (increase of 15 points); and 4% in closing it, 9% of the first generation (increase 9 points). With reference to planning and government, companies that have a protocol remain at 23%, but those that have a succession plan drop to 18%. It must be taken into account that 20% and 23%, respectively, are in process. The incorporation of outsiders into the family is relevant, 19% have done so, and 14% are in the process, mainly because of the knowledge they provide and to help them grow. 15% have incorporated them into management, 11% into boards of directors and 4% into ownership. Shortage of qualified personnel The shortage of qualified personnel has become a major limitation. For companies, the most important skills are motivation, teamwork and knowledge. As for the most difficult positions to fill, the trades stand out (51% companies): mechanics, drivers, welders, assemblers, painters, bricklayers, electricians, fundamentally; and management (34% companies): management or economic management positions. Behind the shortage, companies believe that there is a lack of qualifications (54%); lack of motivation (28%) in terms of involvement, concern, interest in assuming responsibilities, demanding more comfortable working conditions; They also point out the high cost (15%) associated with the lack of supply; and lack of experience (15%). Regarding how they manage the shortage, they mainly do so through training (63% of companies) as a way to solve the lack of training and experience; reinforcing search activities (20%); reorganizing the workforce (12%); and increasing working facilities and conditions (12%) in the sense of increasing the attractiveness of jobs. In general, companies believe that improvements are needed in the educational system (40%); changes in the value system of society (34%) in terms of attitude towards work where commitment should take precedence; promotion (26%) of labor hiring and image of certain trades. Furthermore, connected to values, they recognize the importance of improving working conditions (13%), both in hours and remuneration.",8,61
The discovery of plant melatonin places UMU researchers Josefa Hernández Ruiz and Marino Bañón Arnao as world leaders in their field,"Over the last two decades, researchers and professors at the University of Murcia Josefa Hernández Ruiz and Marino Bañón Arnao have become world leaders in the field of plant biology thanks to their contributions on plant melatonin, called phytomelatonin. Melatonin is a hormonal compound found in mammals and birds and was discovered in plants in 1995. Both UMU researchers first described the hormonal action of melatonin in plants in 2004. Since then, the group of Phytohormones and Plant Development research, made up of professors Hernández Ruiz and Antonio Cano Lario, and directed by Professor Arnao, is an international reference on the physiological aspects regulated by phytomelatonin with more than 100 publications. As a result of all this activity, both have become the first researchers from the University of Murcia to appear in the ranking of the list of highly cited authors of Clarivate Analytics (HiCi) of 2023, an achievement that reflects the impact of their work in research from around the world. In the last two decades, this research activity has been revealing the interesting actions that phytomelatonin has on plant development, with prominent roles in the processes of germination, rooting, growth, photosynthesis, foliar senescence and tropisms (growth of the plant towards a stimulus). such as sunlight or gravitational force); as well as in reproductive processes such as flowering, fruiting and maturation of seeds and fruits. Furthermore, their research has shown that plant melatonin has applications with a great impact on the post-harvest conservation of flowers, fruits and vegetables. On the other hand, the regulatory role that phytomelatonin has in stress situations due to abiotic agents (cold, heat, salinity, drought, toxicity, etc.) and biotic agents (pathogenic agents such as bacteria, fungi and viruses) is very notable, behaving as a plant regulator that modulates the actions of other plant hormones, as well as multiple stages of plant primary and secondary metabolism. Phytomelatonin has been detected in all the plants analyzed, both in edible and wild varieties. The high endogenous levels found in aromatic-medicinal plants stand out especially. This last aspect led the research group to develop a biotechnological process to obtain plants rich in phytomelatonin that would serve as a natural supplement to synthetic melatonin with applications in human, animal, and cosmetic food. In addition, the multiple agronomic applications in seedbeds, greenhouses and field crops have also been proven. All of this has created excellent exploitation expectations through a future technology-based company (EBT) spin-off from the University of Murcia. All the scientific contributions of the group are the result of the work of these researchers from the University of Murcia, who have compiled more than two hundred publications since they began their first studies in 1986 in the field of plant hormones, peroxidases and plant antioxidants. In the 2000s they were pioneers in targeting phytomelatonin and their results were especially decisive between 2004 and 2012. The advances published in the high-impact journals Trends in Plant Science in 2014, 2019 and 2023, and in the Journal of Pineal Research, a journal specialized in melatonin in which they have published ten scientific articles, among many others, have been the decisive boost that has placed them in prominent places both in the HiCi ranking of the most cited in the world and in the prestigious ranking of Stanford University. Both Marino Bañón Arnao and Josefa Hernández Ruiz express their satisfaction with this achievement and wanted to express their gratitude to those who have been their mentors throughout their careers and to those who have collaborated with them throughout these years.

"Entrepreneurial activity in the Region grows by 25 percent, according to the GEM report prepared by the University of Murcia","This Monday, the University of Murcia presented the report Deciphering entrepreneurship in Murcia: Perspectives from GEM (GEM Report 2022-23); which includes the evolution and perspectives of the entrepreneurial situation in the Region of Murcia. This report, the sixteenth edition presented, has been prepared by a research team from the UMU, led by Alicia Rubio, professor at the Faculty of Economics and Business and vice-rector for Students and Employment, with the support of the Ministry of Economy , Treasury and Business through INFO, CaixaBank and Fundación Cajamurcia. One of the main conclusions of the report is that a quarter of the Murcian population perceives good opportunities for entrepreneurship in the next 6 months, with a NECI index of 5, which reflects a promising environment for entrepreneurship and places the Region among the first communities autonomous communities in terms of support for entrepreneurship. The results obtained regarding the entrepreneurial process show that the Region improves in almost all the indicators studied compared to 2021. The TEA indicator, which reflects the real situation of entrepreneurship, registered an increase of 25% compared to 2021, reaching 5.1 % in 2022. In addition, 6.3% of the adult population of the Region of Murcia who owned and managed a business has managed to consolidate. Thus, it is observed how the TEA confirms the upward trend that began in 2021, indicating a robust entrepreneurial environment in the Region, something that is also observed if company closures are analyzed, since in the twelve months prior to the study being carried out the Closing rate was 1.8%, still well below the national average. Thus, the Region of Murcia shows a percentage of business closures lower than the European average and lower than the majority of autonomous communities, reflecting greater stability in its entrepreneurial ecosystem. Although in 2022 the male entrepreneurship rate exceeds the female entrepreneurship rate in all the indicators analyzed, it is observed how the gender gap reduces as the stages of the entrepreneurial process progress. If the motivations of the population to start a business are analyzed, the Region of Murcia is the autonomous community in which it is most common to start a business to create great wealth or generate a very high income and, furthermore, it is among the five communities in which More often than not, a business is created with the intention of making a difference in the world. Gender differences in the most ambitious motivations (making a difference in the world and creating great wealth or generating a very high income) show a change in trend, reversing compared to 2021. In 2022, the proportion of women motivated by both reasons ( 50% and 52%, respectively) exceeds that of men (37% and 48%, respectively). Regarding the profile of the entrepreneur, it is observed how potential and recent entrepreneurs (TEA) are mainly concentrated in the age group of 25 to 44 years, showing a slight decrease in the proportion of young entrepreneurs (18-24 years), both recent as potential, compared to 2021. Regarding the distribution by gender and educational level, men surpassed women in all phases of entrepreneurship in terms of university studies, but women led in postgraduate studies. Financing The average capital required for new business projects has increased significantly to €80,144 euros. Compared to previous years, men tend to use more seed capital, suggesting greater ambition in their initiatives, and personal savings remain the most common source of financing, providing more than half of the seed capital in 2022. It continues to be observing a concentration of entrepreneurial initiatives, initial and consolidated, in the tertiary sector of the economy (consumer services sector and business services). However, unlike Spain, the growth of initiatives in the processing sector in the Region of Murcia is notable. Regarding job creation, in the Region of Murcia a growing trend is observed both in permanent hiring, in the case of entrepreneurial initiatives consolidated since 2021, which continues in 2022 and coincides with the trend at the national level, as in the range of 1-5 employees in recent initiatives. Orientation of the initiatives In relation to the innovative orientation of entrepreneurial initiatives, percentages of innovation in product and process are observed that double and even triple those of consolidated initiatives, so a significant increase in innovation in the entrepreneurial fabric of the Region in the coming years. Likewise, there is a growing trend of women's innovative orientation compared to 2021, considerably reducing the gender gap, in line with the evolution in Spain. Compared to the results obtained in 2021, there is a slight loss of importance in the adaptation and improvement of digitalization after the pandemic in favor of greater relevance to previous digitalization, in line with what is happening on the national scene. Thus, expectations for the adoption of digital technologies in the Region of Murcia show a reduction, probably because large investments have been made in the years just after the pandemic. The growing trend in terms of international orientation continues, and 2.1% of recent initiatives (TEA) can be classified as born-global, with a range of exports that exceeds 75%, a figure somewhat lower than the Spanish average (5%). Women are more inclined than men to internationalization and export throughout the entire entrepreneurial process and this international orientation reaches its maximum in the age group of 25-34, which can guarantee the international projection of these initiatives in time. The international orientation of regional consolidated companies is not located in specific sectors, although the proportion of companies is higher in the extractive and processing sectors, where almost a third of the initiatives export. The largest consolidated initiatives are those with the greatest international orientation, while the family nature does not represent a relevant difference in terms of the degree of international exposure, in line with the rest of Spain. Regarding the sustainable orientation of initiatives, two thirds of regional entrepreneurs, especially women, analyze the social and environmental impact of their activity, with more than 60% taking concrete measures to minimize the environmental impact of their businesses and a third proposing specific social protection actions. Support for business creation Experts in the Region consider that the environment for business creation in the Region of Murcia is moderately favorable, and among the main factors supporting business creation, they continue to highlight the existence and access to commercial and professional infrastructures, closely followed by government programs. While they estimate that government policies, together with the unfavorable conditions of the political, social and institutional context, and insufficient financial support, are the circumstances that make business creation the most difficult.",5,98
"“Recognizing the rights of nature is the legal revolution of the 21st century,” conclude the speakers of the 1st forum 'SDGs, Agenda 2030 and Rights of Nature' organized by the UMU","The University of Murcia (UMU) has organized, through the Chair of Human Rights and Rights of Nature, the 1st university forum 'SDGs, Agenda 2030 and Rights of Nature: walking towards the Earth Assembly'. This two-day forum, framed within the ODSesiones project, brings together more than a dozen professors, researchers and professionals to analyze how to fight the destruction of our habitats in an interdisciplinary way. Specifically, ecologists, lawyers, doctors, economists, communicators and environmental activists will participate until tomorrow, December 5. At the opening, in an event that included the participation of the rector of the UMU, José Luján, and the ten from the Faculty of Law, Francisca Ferrando, the latest book by the professor of the Faculty of Law and director of the Chair of Human Rights and Law at the UMU, Teresa Vicente, entitled 'Ecological justice and rights of nature'. This manual defends the new ecocentric paradigm of ecological justice and its articulation in the field of Ecology, Philosophy and Law, to illuminate a new generation of rights: those that concern nature. Vicente analyzes the path of the Popular Legislative Initiative (ILP) of the Mar Menor, which was approved by the Spanish Parliament in 2022 and gave legal personality to the Mar Menor lagoon and its basin. This law was promoted by an unprecedented social movement, making it the first ecosystem in Europe that is subject to rights. A new contract with nature The speakers concluded that ""we need a living right, which is not discriminatory but rather laws that recover and conserve the main habitats of our planet."" In this sense, the panels of experts delved into the fact that “we must stop treating the earth as an object, reimagining ecology from a philosophical point of view from an organism-subject integration.” “Because recognizing rights to nature is the legal revolution of the 21st century,” they determined. The philosophers Francisco Jarauta and Antonio Campillo, as well as the lawyer and associate professor of Administrative Law at the UMU Sergio Marco, participated in the presentation of this forum. Jarauta defended that, today, “the institutions that were born from World War II are insufficient,” since “we must put the Earth at the center, because we need a new contract with nature,” he argued. Human action For his part, Antonio Campillo, recalled that “we live in the era of the Anthropocene.” “As an example, a fact: the mass of the technosphere weighs more than all the terrestrial biomass. That is, humans move the Earth's crust in a greater number of natural phenomena."" Campillo emphasized that human action “has moved the earth's axis of rotation 80 centimeters due to the extraction of water from aquifers.” “For all this, we are running out of seasons and autumn arrives in Murcia in December,” he reasoned. “Humanity has unleashed this, but we are unable to control it,” summarized this philosopher. At the forum, which was hosted by the UMU faculties of Law and Economics and Business, experts in environmental defense at the national and international level participated, such as the person responsible for capacity development at UNESCO in Latin America, Yuma Inzolia; the CSIC scientist Fernando Valladares; or the president of the Spanish Commission for Refugee Assistance, José Manuel Zaragoza; among others. Visit to the Mar Menor The 1st university forum 'SDGs, Agenda 2030 and Rights of Nature: walking towards the Earth Assembly' will conclude tomorrow with an interpretive visit to the speakers around the Mar Menor, in an activity directed by Pedro Luengo Michel. ODSesiones of the UMU, framed in the promotion of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), has the support of Aguas de Murcia, CaixaBank, Fundación Cajamurcia and the regional government.

The University of Murcia supports 24 percent more students with disabilities than last year,"The University of Murcia is once again a national reference course in attention to diversity thanks to its consolidated support program for students with disabilities and special educational needs. Proof of this is that the UMU Diversity and Volunteering Service has received 534 requests for intervention since the beginning of the course, which is 24.4% more than during the same period last year. Not in vain, the University of Murcia has been one of the Spanish universities with the most students with disabilities in percentage terms for years. Currently, 2.45% of those who study at the UMU have some type of disability or educational need, one point more than the average for Spanish universities (1.5%). The UMU commemorates this week Disability Day, which is celebrated every December 3, and Volunteer Day, on December 5. Both dates are closely linked in the institution, since the volunteer program in which students participate is one of the great strengths of attention to students with special needs. As an example, in just one year, the volunteer project for students with disabilities has gone from having 148 beneficiaries to 361. Thanks to this program, students with educational care needs receive help in taking notes (71%), support in trips (15.5%). Furthermore, in some cases there is also the figure of a tutor (3.5%), specific support in practical classes (5%) and accompaniment in leisure activities (3.5%). In parallel, the University of Murcia is part of actions such as the Inclusive Campus, in which students with intellectual disabilities are trained to acquire skills for employment; and develops an entire strategy to make the university more inclusive in all areas, including access to new technologies. The result of these actions is, for example, that the UMU has recently been one of the three finalists in the national Dicanet awards, whose jury evaluated the set of actions carried out in innovation, such as the specific virtual desktops accessible for students with disabilities or the systems guidance for students with disabilities using Bluetooth beacons.",13,22

Soltec exposes its business model based on sustainability and innovation at the UMU,"The University of Murcia (UMU) hosted, within the framework of the ODSesiones project, which raises awareness about the importance of the SDGs, the conference 'New challenges for photovoltaic solar energy', where the company based in Molina de Segura presented to students from Chemical Engineering its business model, which has sustainability and innovation as its pillars. This conference, part of this month's program, focused on SDG 7 'Clean energy and sanitation', was organized by the professor of the Faculty of Chemistry Mariano Alarcón. Soltec's Director of Innovation Technology, Alejandro Cardona Vélez, reflected on the short and medium-term challenges of renewable energies. In the specific case of photovoltaic solar energy, Cardona explained that ""in just over 10 years it has gone from being questioned as a solvent source for electricity supply in a significant way to being one of the main sources in countries like Spain."" It also analyzed environmental challenges, such as the recycling of solar panels. The Soltec representative defended its “ecovoltaic” philosophy, where the company has managed to “group a series of criteria that a photovoltaic plant must meet to guarantee that it generates the greatest possible positive impact and that, therefore, it is in line with its way.” to understand solar development,” he argued. “In our company we care about areas as diverse as socioeconomic excellence, the circular economy, the protection of biodiversity and the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions,” he explained. In summary, Soltec “sees in ecovoltaic plants an opportunity to promote the growth and development of municipalities and their people,” according to Cardona. “Since developments that follow ecovoltaic values have a driving effect on the local economy, since they stimulate job creation and energize existing economic activity,” he summarized. For Alejandro Cardona, “the sector foresees a potential medium-term demand for renewable energies, especially in synergy with alternatives such as green hydrogen, although its success will depend on the costs of fossil fuels, whose costs are volatile and sensitive to global socio-political conflicts. Finally, he recalled that “the renewable energy sector is growing and needs this new generation of professionals to solve technological challenges to have increasingly greater efficiency in the generation and storage processes, and a reduction in the environmental impact. ” ODSesiones has the support of Aguas de Murcia, CaixaBank, Fundación Cajamurcia and the regional government.

"The writer John Maxwell Coetzee and the telecommunications engineer Mateo Valero, next honorary doctors from the UMU","The Faculty of the University of Murcia, in its session held yesterday afternoon, Thursday, November 30, agreed to the appointment of two new Honoris Causa doctors: the South African writer John Maxwell Coetzee; and the Telecommunications engineer Mateo Valero Cortés. Coetzee, a nationalized Australian, was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature in 2003 and his work is deeply related to apartheid in his native country. The Swedish academy said at the time that this central theme of his novels, far from giving local character to his literature, “makes it universal.” For his part, Mateo Valero Cortés is a doctor of engineering in Telecommunications from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia and a researcher in Computer Architecture and director of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center-National Center for Supercomputing. The UMU Senate, the highest representative body of the institution, also approved the awarding of three Medals of Honor: to the journalist Piedad Alarcón García, to the writer Dionisia García and to the writer Nuncio Ordine, posthumously. Pity Alarcón, a native of Guadix, but living in Murcia for decades, was the first professor to teach subjects related to journalism at the University of Murcia and one of the sponsors of the Faculty of Communication and Documentation of the UMU. In his professional career he has developed his work in very diverse media: Radio Juventud in Malaga, Radio Nacional de España in Zaragoza and Madrid; as well as at TVE, where he has spent most of his professional life. The writer Dionisia García, a native of Fuente Álamo (Albacete), but resident in Murcia since 1970, is one of the most powerful and fruitful literary voices on the Murcian literature scene of the last century. The International Poetry Prize of the University of Murcia, which has been held for more than 20 years, bears his name. The Cloister also wanted to recognize with the medal, posthumously, Nuccio Ordine, Italian professor and writer, specialist in the art and literature of the Renaissance and one of the most prominent personalities in the world on the cultural scene. Ordine was linked to the University of Murcia for more than 20 years and died in June 2023. Likewise, the faculty agreed to award the Patronage Medal to businessman Juan Muñoz Muñoz, founder and manager of the company Industrias Técnicas Ganaderas (INTEGA), livestock services company created in 1983. Its relationship with the University of Murcia began with the start-up of the Veterinary Teaching Farm of the University of Murcia in 2001.",10,98

Members of the UMU Animal Phylogeny and Evolution research group warn in Nature of the risk of pesticides for pollinators,"The Department of Zoology and Physical Anthropology of the University of Murcia (UMU) has participated in a study that has shown that, despite having the most rigorous risk assessment process in the world, the use of authorized pesticides in European plantations continues to negatively affect other living organisms. Among them are bumblebees, a key wild and commercial pollinator whose colonies are also being affected by this. Specifically, pesticides reduce the weight of bumblebee nests and limit their growth, which has important ecological consequences. This important finding has just been published in Nature, one of the most prestigious scientific journals in the world. Pilar de la Rúa, professor of Zoology at the UMU and author of the article, highlights that “Spain stands out for its great diversity of pollinators at the European level, so these results are of vital importance to be able to design strategies that protect our rich insect communities. pollinators.” On the other hand, Vicente Martínez, researcher from the same Department and also author of the article, adds that “the conclusions obtained show how far we are still from understanding the effect that pesticides have on pollinators. In addition, they highlight the need to carry out large-scale studies to understand the impacts of human activities on biodiversity.” Both researchers emphasize that many crops depend on pollination carried out by insects, therefore, this damage to pollinators has a direct effect on crop productivity, which translates into economic losses. Bees under study from the EU The UMU Zoology and Physical Anthropology team has led the study experiments carried out in the crop fields of Spain, specifically in Murcia, and framed within the PoshBee project, which is intended to monitor and improve bee health across Europe. Professor Mark Brown of Royal Holloway University of London, coordinator of PoshBee, said: ""The scale of this work represents a step forward in our understanding of the impact of agrochemicals on pollinator health. It has been made possible by funding from the European Union, which has backed the project involving 13 countries. Bumblebees, and other animals, do not recognize international borders and, to protect them, we must adopt an equally international approach."" Drastic reduction of pollinators The data show that 60% of the bumblebee nests used in the study were not being effectively protected with the current pesticide regulations of the European Union, significantly reducing the performance of the bumblebee colonies.

I have started countless novels, but this was the first one I have finished. At a certain moment, I realized that life is not eternal and I told myself 'either wake up or there is no novel.' And in the end it came out through work, work and work.” When asked by Soledad Puértolas about the creative process of the novel, Calatrava stated that “in my case, more than writing, it has been an arduous job of erasing: if I have written a hundred words I have erased five hundred and I have redone a thousand. I have had that time and that pause that age gives you.” The novel The novel tells the story of a recently retired insurance agent who receives a job offer from his former boss. The task is simple: you must follow up on policyholders who make claims against insurance companies to discover all those who try to defraud them.

UMU professor Teresa Vicente presents her book 'Ecological justice and rights of nature' within the framework of ODSesiones,"The University of Murcia (UMU) hosted the presentation of the book 'Ecological justice and rights of nature', by the professor of the Faculty of Law and director of the Chair of Human Rights and Rights of Nature Teresa Vicente. This work, edited by Tirant lo Blanc (2023), was presented within the framework of the conference 'Energy transition and the rights of nature', organized by the professor of the Faculty of Chemistry Mariano Alarcón, within the program of the ODSesiones project , which this month organizes activities around SDG 7 'Affordable and clean energy'. In this book, which has the collaboration of researchers Angélica Mendieta Ramírez, Cristina Holgado Sáez, María Lilia Cedillo Ramírez and Elda Margarita Hernández Rejón, the new ecocentric paradigm of ecological justice and its articulation in the field of Ecology is defended. Philosophy and Law, to illuminate a new generation of rights: those that concern nature. For Professor Vicente, “we summarize a new Copernican revolution that aims to reconcile the human being with the terrestrial dwelling to which he belongs. Ecological justice and the rights of Nature have ceased to be mere theoretical proposals and have already been introduced into positive Law,” he explained. 'Ecological justice and rights of nature' analyzes the path of the Popular Legislative Initiative (ILP) of the Mar Menor, which was approved by the Spanish parliament in 2022 and gave legal personality to the Mar Menor lagoon and its basin. This law was promoted by an unprecedented social movement, making it “the first ecosystem in Europe that is subject to rights,” he recalled. Effective protection The conference was also attended by the magistrate of the Investigative Court No. 4 of Cartagena, Raúl Sánchez Conesa, the first judge to apply in Spain the law that gives legal personality to the Mar Menor. Specifically, this court investigates the administrative responsibility of the project to seal the 'Jenny' pond carried out by the Autonomous Community and reported by Seprona in 2013. This is a piece derived from the main case about this mining waste pond located in the Sierra Minera to clarify what administrative responsibility derives from the failed sealing of the 'Jenny' pond and the transfer of the waste to the Los Blancos cutting. Seprona agents denounced the discharges from the pond, despite the obligations of the environmental impact assessment. In his intervention, Judge Raúl Sánchez differentiated between “moderate anthropocentrism, which does not create legal personality for ecosystems, and convinced ecocentrism, as is the case of the ILP of the Mar Menor and the Spanish legal system.” He defended that “the only way to confront the climate crisis, global warming or protect our ecosystems is through the Law,” because “it is alive, it is interpreted and it can be changed,” he revealed. Green transition The conference emphasized that the law that grants legal personality to the Mar Menor, the first European natural area with this recognition, has been based on the experiences of countries in America and Oceania in which rivers or lakes have been endowed with that legal recognition, which aims to serve as a tool for the “effective” protection of important ecosystems of great ecological value that “are threatened by the current model of production and consumption,” according to Teresa Vicente. The objective of this text is that the Mar Menor ""has a charter of rights that respects its ecological law and guarantees its legitimate rights to live, to repair the damage and to recover."" In addition, it will serve to ""pursue and sanction those people, companies or entities that attack the ecosystem."" ODSesiones of the UMU, framed in the promotion of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), has the support of Aguas de Murcia, CaixaBank, Fundación Cajamurcia and the regional government. This initiative organizes activities on SDG 7 'Affordable and non-polluting energy' until December 5, 2023.

UMU researcher Adelaida Parreño is ahead of the EU with her proposal for a citizen initiative to address energy poverty,"The proposal carried out by Adelaida Parreño Rodríguez, researcher at the Department of Information and Communications Engineering at the University of Murcia (UMU), involves the creation of energy communities with a form of collective self-consumption of solar energy between public entities and citizens. to address energy poverty. This initiative led by Parreño in collaboration with the Carlos III University of Madrid, the UMU MASTERPIECE project and the Polytechnic of Cartagena, shows how these communities, in addition to reducing economic inequality and promoting energy independence, also help reduce the footprint environmental, illuminating a more just and sustainable future. This model is being developed at high speed in Spain; since 2018 alone, the installed power has multiplied by 20. For this study, they built a self-consumption energy community in a neighborhood of Getafe in Madrid. And they demonstrated how the approach of a citizen initiative proposal in collaboration with public entities can help reduce energy poverty, because its contribution to the electrical grid at low cost promotes access to renewables for all types of citizens. “With this work we anticipate what the European Commission has recently published, which in the energy field focuses on promoting inclusion and equal access to basic supplies with a focus on cooperation and energy exchange between members of the community,” says Parreño. Eliminate financial barriers The initiative seeks to improve accessibility to sustainable energy by spreading the cost of installing solar panels between the public entity and non-vulnerable households. The latter contribute a small monthly fee for a few years to cover their part of the investment, while vulnerable households are exempt. This solution not only eliminates a financial barrier, but, as the study reveals, allows both non-vulnerable and vulnerable households to save on their electricity bills. At a time when facing the electricity bill has become increasingly difficult, it is essential to facilitate access to renewable energy and self-consumption to promote energy equity and protect the most vulnerable consumers.",7,59

Scientists from UMU and IMIB explore a new treatment against rare genetic diseases,"The University of Murcia (UMU) and the Murcian Institute for Biosanitary Research (IMIB) have achieved an outstanding achievement in research on two rare and potentially fatal genetic diseases: congenital dyskeratosis and congenital neutropenias. They have developed aptamers, - DNA or RNA sequences that can take different forms that act in a similar way to antibodies, like a dart with a high capacity to bind to specific cellular components -, which activate the formation of blood cells involved in the first immune system response. The results of this revolutionary study offer great hope for those affected by these pathologies. Dyskeratosis congenita is an exceptionally rare disease, affecting approximately one case per million people. Its symptoms are the presence of abnormalities in the nails, skin and mucous membranes, but they can lead to a significantly increased risk of developing serious medical problems, such as bone marrow failure, necessary to fight infections, and cancer. Congenital neutropenias are a heterogeneous group of diseases that affect an even greater number of individuals, with an incidence of between three to eight cases per million people. Patients with severe congenital neutropenias are especially vulnerable to recurrent, potentially life-threatening infections, which can range from otitis and gingivitis to pneumonia. This burden of disease can always accompany the individual, which significantly affects their quality of life and that of their family members, which is why it requires early diagnosis and specialized medical care. Treatment intolerance Treatment for these rare medical conditions can make a substantial difference in patients' quality of life. For congenital neutropenias, the main treatment involves daily administration of G-CSF, which reduces the frequency and severity of infections. However, approximately 10% of patients do not respond to this therapy and continue to face an elevated risk of severe bacterial infections. “Recurrence of fever outbreaks in children can have dramatic consequences on the overall quality of life of patients and their caregivers, negatively interfering with school attendance or daily activities, and can generate a deep feeling of frustration in families,” explain UMU researcher Victoriano Mulero-Méndez and Francisca Alcaraz- Pérez, from IMIB. However, the UMU-IMIB research team has managed to turn aptamers into a possible solution to these rare and complex diseases: ""Our team has been working tirelessly to find innovative solutions for people living with dyskeratosis. congenital or with congenital neutropenias. Aptamers represent a highly specific approach that could revolutionize the treatment of neutropenias,"" says biologist María Luisa Cayuela Fuentes, principal investigator of the study. Although the research, whose first author is Dr. Elena Martínez Balsalobre, is still in its early stages, the results offer great hope for patients and their families. The next steps involve further refining the aptamer-based therapy and conducting clinical trials to evaluate its safety and efficacy in humans. This exciting study highlights the urgent need to develop new therapeutic approaches in these diseases beyond palliative treatments. Specialized medical care, access to effective therapies and continued research are essential to improve the quality of life and prospects of these patients in their fight against these rare diseases.",16,88

The UMU develops the first intraocular lenses to see at all distances without glare and with improved peripheral vision,"The research team at the Optics Laboratory of the University of Murcia has developed the first intraocular lenses so that patients undergoing cataract surgery can see from all distances, both near and far, without the need to wear glasses. and with improved peripheral perception. Thanks to these lenses, the quality of life of people who undergo this eye surgery, which is the most performed in the world, will improve. In addition, this advance can also benefit people with presbyopia, replacing the crystalline lens with this type of lens. Among the innovations that these new lenses provide, it is also worth noting that they avoid flares and halos and nighttime lighting effects that are usually typical in the multifocal lens designs that are currently marketed. Voptica SL, a spin-off company arising from the Optics Laboratory of the University of Murcia, has begun to market these new lenses, developed thanks to the research of professors Pablo Artal, Eloy A. Villegas, Pedro M. Prieto and Jose Mª Marín , in collaboration with the Oftalvist la Vega clinic (Murcia) and the staff of Voptica SL. The Journal of Refractive Surgery has recently published the first clinical results on visual performance, independence from glasses and the quality of vision at different distances of the new intraocular lenses, called ArtIOLs; specifically the Art40 and Art70 models. During the trial period, the lenses were implanted in 60 eyes of 30 patients so that one eye had the Art40 model and the other eye the Art70 model. These lenses were designed in the shape of an inverted meniscus to improve peripheral visual quality and with an aspherical surface to encourage different depths of focus. This combination allowed most patients to have clear vision at all distances without wearing glasses and without adverse light effects, typical of multifocal lenses.",16,142
The University of Murcia develops a project in Ceuta to combat anti-Muslim hate speech through video art,"The University of Murcia participates in the autonomous city of Ceuta in a project aimed at combating anti-Muslim hate speech and that places special emphasis on digital platforms. This project comes to Ceuta thanks to Professor Pilar Garrido Clemente, principal researcher of the European project Evaluating Campaigns against Hate (ECO). The public presentation was attended by the Minister of Education, Culture, Youth and Sports, Pilar Orozco, and the president of the Al Fanar Foundation, Pedro Rojo. The objective of this project, co-financed by the Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values Program (CERV), and led by the University of Murcia, is “to develop a methodology to evaluate the campaigns against hate that go beyond quantitative or complacent analysis” according to Pilar Garrido. In Ceuta, work will be done using video art and photography as tools for the integration of Christian, Muslim, Jewish and Hindu communities, which is why the city was chosen, as Garrido explains. The teacher explained that Ceuta will be the first city to begin the action part of the project ""because it has a completely unique and diverse idiosyncrasy."" In addition, actions will also be carried out in Madrid and Murcia with the aim of combating phobias, hate speech anti-Muslim inside and outside of social networks, particularly among the young population. This project represents an innovative knowledge transfer strategy that combines academic research with social action, contributing to the construction of a communication culture that fosters social cohesion In this European project, the University of Murcia has the collaboration of the professors of the Faculty of Documentation and Communication, Rocío Zamora and María del Mar Grandío, as well as the participation of the University of Salamanca and the Al Fanar Foundation organizations for the Arabic Knowledge and Creating Traces.",13,84
The president of the Autonomous Community visits the facilities of the Scientific and Technical Research Area of the University of Murcia,"The president of the Autonomous Community, Fernando López Miras, visited this Thursday the facilities of the Scientific and Technical Research Area of the University of Murcia (ACTI), which provides transversal support to the research groups of the University of Murcia and all research centers of the Region. Led by the Vice-Rector for Research, María Senena Corbalán; from the vice-rector for Coordination and Quality, Alfonsa García; the head of ACTI, Roque Ortiz, and the researcher from the Faculty of Biology María Ángeles Esteban, who carries out much of her research testing at the ACTI facilities; The president and the advisor of Universities, Juan María Vázquez, have learned the details of the operation of the facilities and the service they provide. The ACTI has more than forty laboratories spread across seven buildings, located on the Espinardo Campus and the Health Sciences Campus, from where they provide support to 118 research groups from the University of Murcia and 40 from the IMIB; the Murcian Institute for Biosanitary Research, of which the UMU is also a part. In addition, service is also offered to other public organizations, private companies and individuals. In total, ACTI has a thousand users a year. During his visit, the president of the Community received explanations about the operation of some of the innovative ACTI laboratories. During the visit, María Senena Corbalán highlighted the investment that the Scientific and Technical Research Area has received in recent years and that, among other achievements, allowed the inauguration last April of 25 biosafety level 2 laboratories for research; as well as the construction of a level 3 biocontainment laboratory for experimentation with infectious agents under safe conditions on the Health Sciences Campus. “ACTI allows our research community to advance in knowledge, as it is equipped with high-performance technologies and highly specialized personnel that allows us to help research personnel develop very innovative projects in such important fields as agriculture, pharmacology, biomedicine, marine sciences. or animal and plant biotechnology, among others,"" said Corbalán, who added that the operation of the area also makes it a great mixed teaching-research asset for undergraduate, master's and doctoral students, since they can face problems and real projects, which provides them with very high quality training. For his part, the president of the Autonomous Community has taken advantage of his visit to the laboratories to announce the call for Saavedra Fajardo aid to attract talent, which this year has funding of two million euros.",16,123
CEMOP investigation indicates an increase in the emotional polarization of the electorate,"This Thursday, the CEMOP Research Group of the UMU presented the results of the III National Political Polarization Survey. The study is part of a research project funded by the Seneca Foundation of the Region of Murcia and was carried out during the 23J general election campaign, and includes 1223 interviews using the CATI system (computer-assisted telephone interviews), with a representative sample of the Spanish population. One of the main results of the study is that the affective polarization of the electorate continues to grow in our country: the indicator used to calculate this phenomenon (API) is higher in 2023 (4.56) than that obtained in 2022 (4.40). and this was in turn higher than that obtained in 2021 (3.98). Emotional tensions at the political level continue to intensify. Regarding media consumption, polarization and selective exposure, the study highlights that citizens tend to consume those media with which they believe they have a greater ideological identification. People on the left prefer to be informed through La 1 de RTVE and La Sexta. For those on the right, their favorite channel is Antena 3. The highest percentage of consumers of regional channels is among those located on the extreme left. People who do not use television or consult newspapers to monitor the campaign are those who have lower levels of affective polarization. Regarding the use of social networks to stay up to date with political news, the study concludes that 42% of Spaniards used social networks such as Facebook, Twitter or TikTok to stay up to date with political news. Among those who used them, another 42% affirm that they came across news or publications unfavorable to the party or candidate that generated the most sympathy every day, without searching for them. This is what has been called ""incidental consumption"" (casual) and questions whether these platforms function as ""echo chambers"", that is, that we are only in contact with content in accordance with our ideas. Voters from parties located at the ideological extremes (Vox and Sumar) are those who have used social networks the most. This result must also be understood as related to the generational gap in the use of these channels, which coincides with a generational gap in support for the different parties. Changes in feelings towards parties and leaders The research also concludes that the levels of rejection towards the PSOE have been reduced, compared to the years 2021 and 2022, and sympathy for this formation has increased. For its part, Sumar arouses less rejection than Unidas Podemos. As for the leaders, Feijóo generated 13.4 points more positive sentiment than Pablo Casado in 2022 and in 2023 the difference already reaches 17.4. In parallel, there has been a growth in support for the figure of Pedro Sánchez (from 16.2% in 2021 to 31.3% in 2023). The antipathy aroused by Yolanda Díaz has also decreased between 2022 and 2023 by 6.7 points. Díaz generates 29.6 points (in 2023) and 22.9 points (in 2022) less antipathy than Pablo Iglesias. Vox and Abascal: those that generate the most rejection Vox is the party that arouses the most rejection (69.8%), while the PSOE is the one that gathers the most feelings of support (31.7%). These results coincide with those of the two previous surveys. Although Abascal is the leader who generates the most antipathy, he is also the one who awakens the most positive feelings among his own voters. However, he arouses more antipathy on the left than Núñez Feijóo, so he appears to be a leadership capable of provoking intense passions among his own and intense rejections among voters of the opposing ideological bloc. It is, therefore, a highly polarizing leadership. Electoral campaign 'Repeal sanchismo' and 'stop the reactionary wave' were the two major campaign frameworks promoted by the parties of the different blocs and the UMU research group has analyzed the impact it could have had on the electorate. 30% of interviewees very or fairly strongly supported the message of ""stopping the reactionary wave"" and another 30% supported the idea of ""repealing Sanchismo"", which, the researchers conclude, were polarizing frames during the campaign. The proposal to ""repeal sanchismo"" generated more support among Vox voters than among those of the PP. It did little to attract dubious socialist voters, which constituted one of the PP's strategic objectives and ended up functioning as an element of threat that aroused adverse reactions among progressive citizens, especially among women. Men (35%) were 9 points more in favor of ""repealing sanchismo"" than women (26%). For their part, upon hearing this phrase, 54% of socialist voters and 56% of Sumar voters felt mainly anger and fear. Polarization around public policies: the trans law, the one that divides the most Of the four measures that the interviewees were asked about (related to abortion, climate change, immigration and transsexuality), the initiative of Pedro's executive Sánchez most polarized during the campaign was the 'trans law'. The legislative changes on abortion, immigration and climate change, issues typical of the cultural battle and that could be considered controversial, appear with support levels higher than 55% and rejection levels lower than 25%. In the case of the 'trans law', however, there is no social consensus, according to the conclusions of the survey carried out by the CEMOP. Democratic values of Spaniards Those interviewed show considerable support for the idea that ""when the country is in danger, it is preferable to have strong leaders who act decisively, even if this means altering the usual democratic procedures."" An idea that entails significant risks. The illegalization of certain parties and the position against judges being able to contradict the will of parliament also seem to attract a lot of support. Interviewees with a higher level of affective polarization tend to be more favorable to reversing certain democratic norms than those less polarized. Men and women increasingly divided politically: is gender the new political cleavage in Spain? Women have more sympathy for Pedro Sánchez (30.9%), followed by Alberto Núñez Feijóo (25.1%), Yolanda Díaz (21.1%) and the Vox leader, Santiago Abascal (4%) is further away. . Men, however, show greater support for the conservative leader, Alberto Núñez Feijóo (27.9%), followed by Pedro Sánchez (23.6%) and Yolanda Díaz (15.6%), and show greater support for Santiago Abascal (10.5%) than women. Vox is the party that produces the most rejection among those surveyed and in which the most differences are observed between the feelings declared by men and women. For its part, the PSOE vote is increasingly feminized, compared to a clearly masculinized Vox vote. With all this data, one could raise the possibility that gender is becoming another political cleavage, in the style of social class, religion or territorial identity. More information.

UMU researcher José Luis Hernández Ramos receives one of the Leonardo scholarships from the BBVA Foundation,"The researcher from the University of Murcia (UMU) José Luis Hernández has been selected to receive one of the “Leonardo Scholarships for Researchers and Cultural Creators” from the BBVA Foundation in the 2023 call for the GLADIATOR project (usinG Large lAnguage models for prIvacy- aware Analysis of cybersecuriTy information). Learning based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) opens up a world of real possibilities ranging from medical care to imminent autonomous driving. But generating a text with Chat GTP is not the same risk as leaving a life or human safety in these intelligent machines. This proposal seeks to use text-generating AI systems such as Chat GTP or LLaMA to help improve how information about cyberattacks and vulnerabilities on the Internet is handled. To do this, the project will adjust and adapt these applications to the context of cybersecurity through a compilation of relevant information sources on the subject. In addition, GLADIATOR will analyze the use of federated learning techniques, which consists of training multiple devices without sharing data between them, so as not to have to share their own cybersecurity information, such as data on threats and vulnerabilities. The objective is that different systems or organizations can create or adjust a cybersecurity-related model without having to share their data. 58 projects selected among the 1,116 presented The Leonardo Scholarships for Researchers and Cultural Creators of the 2023 call, with a global endowment of 2,200,000 euros, are aimed at researchers and cultural creators in intermediate stages of their career, between 30 and 45 years old. , which are characterized by significant scientific, technological or cultural production.

UMU researchers collaborate on a key study that identifies one of the causes of male subfertility,"An international team of scientists with the notable collaboration of researchers from the University of Murcia (UMU), has discovered that the absence or deficiency of a gene produces immotile sperm, incapable of fertilizing. This study has been published in the prestigious journal PNAS and represents a great advance in understanding male fertility because it is the first time that the crucial metabolic role of the adenylate kinase 9 (AK9) gene in sperm motility and its interaction with the ovum. The group led by Alfonso Gutiérrez Adán, from the National Institute of Agricultural and Food Research and Technology (INIA-CSIC), generated transgenic mice without AK9. Through the electron microscopy study carried out by UMU researchers Manuel Avilés Sánchez and Miriam Balastegui Alarcón, they analyzed the semen of the males and verified how the sperm presented numerous abnormalities, such as a lack of energy or a high percentage of sperm with tails. deformed “It was a surprise to find these abnormalities in the structure of the sperm flagellum when they looked apparently normal when observed at low magnifications. There were even some that were immature or had several tails, a fact that is not normal,” says Miriam Balastegui. Livestock fertilization to understand human fertilization A Holstein bull incapable of fertilizing only 10% of the cows was the trigger for this research that helps to understand a little more about the causes of male subfertility in species, including humans. For Manuel Avilés, “this finding will allow many couples to have an explanation about the reason why the sperm do not move,” which highlights the great importance of carrying out an evaluation of sperm quality when it is not possible. has no choice but to resort to artificial insemination.",11,13

The Stanford University ranking places 62 researchers from the University of Murcia in the world elite for the impact of their work,"Researchers from Stanford University (USA) have recently published the annual update of their Updated science-wide author databases of standardized citation indicators, a publication known as the Stanford researchers ranking, which classifies the world's research elite based on parameters that measure the impact and quality of their work. In the latest update, published on October 4, 2023, 62 researchers from the University of Murcia are among the most influential. This ranking uses the SCOPUS scientific publications database as a source and to prepare it, the impact of research is taken into account following different quality criteria in three areas. The classification orders, on the one hand, those who have had the most influence due to their works published in 2022 and, on the other, the ranking measures the influence throughout the entire career. Fifty-two people linked to the University of Murcia appear in the ranking for their work during 2022 and 35 for their contributions throughout their academic career. This is the greatest presence in this classification that the University of Murcia has achieved so far. The study only includes the 2% of researchers worldwide with the highest score in their area of knowledge, so being included in it means being among the world's research elite. The excellent results obtained by people linked to the UMU also acquire value in the context of Spanish universities, since the University occupies 14th place among all the organizations dedicated to research in Spain with the greatest presence in this ranking; a more than outstanding position if one takes into account that in Spain there are 91 universities, to which we must add the centers and institutes dedicated to research. Considered the most prestigious in the world, the Stanford ranking includes some 200,000 scientists belonging to different areas of study.

The la Caixa Foundation promotes two biomedical projects at the University of Murcia to transfer its cutting-edge research from the laboratory to patients,"The ”la Caixa” Foundation will allocate 3.3 million euros to promote 29 innovative biomedical projects with the capacity to reach the market and society. These are projects developed in 20 research centers, hospitals and universities in Spain and Portugal, and selected within the framework of the 2023 call of the new CaixaImpulse Health Innovation program. The initiative aims to encourage research to leave the laboratory and reach patients in the form of solutions capable of contributing to improving their health. In this call, two projects from the University of Murcia have been selected. A non-invasive uterine fluid collection device to improve the detection of endometrial cancer Researcher Pilar Coy, from the University of Murcia, leads a project that receives 149,500 euros from the ”la Caixa” Foundation to promote the design of a collection device Minimally invasive uterine fluid collection to improve endometrial cancer detection. Currently, endometrial cancer is diagnosed through the analysis of tissue obtained from an endometrial biopsy, which is painful and, due to the scarcity of the sample collected, provides an inaccurate diagnosis in 55% of cases. This forces us to resort to more complex and expensive interventions, such as hysteroscopy, to diagnose these patients. Consequently, it is necessary and urgent to develop an effective and less invasive test to detect this type of tumors. Uterine fluid has great potential as a source of specific biomarkers for endometrial cancer. However, there are no adequate devices on the market that allow it to be collected, since those on the market provide samples that are either contaminated by the bleeding that occurs during aspiration of the fluid, or diluted by the use of washings. The project's driving team has designed a device that allows pure, uncontaminated uterine fluid to be collected through capillary action, in an effective and minimally invasive manner. In this phase of the project, the objective is to obtain a mold that allows this device to be manufactured from a biocompatible material. Initially, it is intended to produce 200 units and carry out a feasibility study on patients from two hospitals to validate the medical device. New cell therapy to treat glioblastomas For her part, researcher Rut Valdor, also from the University of Murcia, leads another project, endowed with 150,000 euros from the ”la Caixa” Foundation, is developing a new cell therapy to stop the growth of glioblastomas, a very aggressive type of brain tumor with very high mortality. In previous studies, the team has achieved promising results by acting on the pericytes of the brain, cells that surround blood vessels and that have a defense function that is affected by cancer cells, which favors the progression of glioblastoma through a mechanism known as chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). Researchers have developed a method to isolate and use genetically modified pericytes without AMC as a tool with potential use in the treatment of glioblastoma and that could possibly be used for other types of cancer. The results obtained so far by the team are promising, both in in vitro and in vivo models. At this stage, the project will focus its efforts on the development of a preclinical study to validate the effectiveness of this new therapeutic strategy using an animal model based on mice that develop human glioblastoma. In addition, a manufacturing process for modified pericytes from human fat will be established that meets the efficacy and toxicity requirements to be used as a possible future medicine. Results of the 2023 call By business area, 13 of the projects belong to the field of therapies, 9 to diagnosis, 5 to medical devices and 2 to digital health. Regarding financing, the winners receive, depending on the degree of maturity of the project, between 50,000 and 500,000 euros to develop it in the following 2 years. In this call, 15 projects have accessed phase 1 (up to 50,000 euros); 12, to phase 2 (up to 150,000 euros), and 2, to phase 3 (up to 500,000 euros). The program allows that, when projects reach specific development milestones and after an assessment by the evaluation committee, they can advance to subsequent phases with greater financing. The winners - from among more than 300 applications received - have been evaluated by a panel of international experts and professionals in the field of life and health sciences. CaixaImpulse Innovation provides support to biomedical projects in the field of innovation and transfer, helping researchers to validate their assets and define their exploitation and valorization strategy to bring the projects closer to the market, so in addition to financial support they will also have access to mentoring. , consulting and support from international experts in different areas of the innovation ecosystem. Likewise, researchers leading projects in phase 2 will receive specialized training for 4 weeks, spread between Barcelona and Madrid, on technology transfer, intellectual property legislation, presentation to investors and closing of commercial agreements. The call is carried out in collaboration with Caixa Capital Risc, one of the main venture capital investors in Spain, with more than twenty years of experience. Furthermore, in Portugal, the call is made in partnership with the Fundação para a Ciência ea Tecnologia (FCT), of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Education of Portugal, which subsidizes two of the selected Portuguese projects. The ”la Caixa” Foundation has maintained its commitment to innovation and transfer in biomedicine and health since 2015, when the entity created the first support program. To date, the ”la Caixa” Foundation has allocated 21.3 million euros to support 202 projects, which have led to the creation of 42 spin offs (derived companies), which in turn have obtained additional co-financing, through from other competitive calls or private investors, worth more than 100 million euros.",16,27

The UMU is the Spanish university with the most volunteer projects,"The University of Murcia is the Spanish university from which the most volunteering projects are promoted, according to the XI Study on University Volunteering prepared by the Mutua Madrileña Foundation, which indicates that 19,460 students from all over the country participated in volunteering actions during last year through their universities, which represents 13% more than the previous year. Specifically, according to this study, the UMU carried out 430 actions during the 2022/2023 academic year, which places it first in the country. After the University of Murcia, the University of Girona appears in the study, with 326 initiatives, and the University of Santiago de Compostela, with 285 projects. The volunteer actions of the University of Murcia are carried out through the Diversity and Volunteering Service (ADYV). A large part of these projects carried out by Spanish universities are carried out in collaboration with other entities. 63% are developed in collaboration with a non-profit entity and are carried out thanks to the contribution of the students. The report also draws the profile of young people who volunteer during their university years. Thus, eight out of ten are women, they study in the field of Social and Legal Sciences, and they dedicate an average of between 2 and 4 hours a week to altruistic activities aimed, fundamentally, at minors in vulnerable situations and at groups in risk of social exclusion. Furthermore, nine out of ten volunteer projects in which students participate are carried out in Spain and last, on average, between three and six months. However, the report warns that their work ""suffers from funding"", and only 27% of the universities consulted acknowledge allocating a budget of more than 25,000 euros. This study was carried out on the occasion of the launch of the XI University Volunteer Awards, awards promoted by the Mutua Madrileña Foundation to support, recognize and make visible the solidarity work of young Spanish university students. In this new edition, the awards increase both their financial prize, up to 50,000 euros, and the number of awarded projects, which goes from six to eight and the 'Solidarity University' candidacy has been created. The deadline for submission to these awards will be open until October 31 and the rules can be consulted at 'www.premiosvoluntariado.com'. Source: Europa Press",8,155
The UMU will carry out a study on the irregular economy in the Region in collaboration with the CES and the Autonomous Community,"The University of Murcia will carry out a study on the situation of the irregular economy in the Region of Murcia, which will be carried out within the framework of a collaboration agreement between the University, the Economic and Social Council (CES) and the Ministry of Education , Vocational Training and Employment. The signing of this agreement took place at La Convalcencia, headquarters of the rectorate of the University of Murcia. Specifically, the study will pay special attention to irregularities in the labor market. The rector of the University of Murcia, José Luján; the president of the CES, José Antonio Cobacho; and the Minister of Education, Vocational Training and Employment, Víctor Marín, have been in charge of signing the agreement. The rector, José Luján, for his part, explained that this work comes to “give continuity to studies that the CES has been doing since the nineties” and has highlighted that it is a “very good example of interdisciplinary collaboration and a of the ways that the university offers itself to society to generate and transmit knowledge.” The objective of this study is to delimit the economic and social causes and effects of the irregular economy in the Region, as well as the basic characteristics of the regional labor market and its distinctive features in the Spanish and European scenario. The study will be directed by José Colino, professor of Applied Economics at the University of Murcia, who has explained that the task assigned will focus on making a diagnosis of the scope of the irregular economy in the Region of Murcia in order, based on this analysis, be able to propose measures that reduce the scope of this hidden economy. Colino recalled that all previous studies on this issue place the Region of Murcia as the community in which the hidden economy represents a higher percentage of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The investigation will establish a catalog of the measures proposed and implemented by the different administrations to combat the underground economy and labor irregularities, evaluating the results achieved to the extent possible. Likewise, the actions that are currently considered of interest for the reduction of the underground economy will be systematized, based on the results obtained from the different parts of the research. This study will collect a quantitative estimate of the different labor irregularities in the Region of Murcia, through a survey of a sample of 2,000 people between 16 and 64 years old. As a previous step, the typology of labor irregularities prepared for the last study must be updated. In addition, the evolution of the main labor irregularities will be established, the sectors most prone to concealment will be identified, as well as the territorial distribution of labor irregularities. The research will also evaluate the perception of Murcian society regarding undeclared work, estimating the degree of tolerance that exists based on certain variables such as, for example, tax pressure, the sign of the economic situation, the risk of sanctions and the conditions of life of employed and unemployed. The research is valued at 70,000 euros, of which 35,000 will be co-financed by the Autonomous Community.",8,66
The University of Murcia inaugurates the first teaching innovation laboratory of the Spanish university,"The University of Murcia inaugurated this Tuesday the first teaching innovation laboratory of the Spanish university in which new teaching methodologies will be analyzed to observe their results and then be able to apply them to classrooms. This new space, located in the Luis Vives building on the Espinardo Campus, was presented in an event in which the rector, José Luján, participated; the vice-rector of Studies, Sonia Madrid; and the Minister of the Environment, Universities, Research and Mar Menor. The space is made up of two large classrooms. The first of them is equipped with an interactive whiteboard, murals and audiovisual means to project content; in addition to a 3D printer, virtual reality glasses, graphic tablets, projectors, overhead observation cameras, the possibility of recording and live broadcasting, among other resources. With all this technology, other analogue ones such as roll-top games and board games also coexist. The room also has extensive bibliographic material on different teaching methodologies. Next to the innovation laboratory itself, there is an observation room from which live monitoring of what happens in the laboratory is carried out and the teaching methodologies used are delved into. The Vice-Rector for Studies has been working on this new project for two years to build a space where teachers and students can interact with different tools, both technological and non-technological, and test new methodologies. To do this, similar initiatives developed in other universities such as Harvard University, the University of Helsinki or the University of Exeter have been taken as an example. The University of Murcia has made a commitment to promote innovation in all its areas and today it is in the top positions in terms of teaching innovation among Spanish universities. Currently, the institution has more than 200 teaching innovation groups that regularly participate in conferences, publish their work in specialized journals or develop high-impact European projects. In addition, more than 300 teaching innovation projects are launched annually to transfer this teaching innovation to the different degrees of the institution. Any teacher at the University of Murcia can use this space with their students when they consider it necessary to evaluate or test a new teaching tool. To do so, they only need to reserve the space through the Innovation Unit. Two 'escape rooms' to get to know the space To make the advantages of this new space known to the university community, two 'escape rooms' designed by the company Mythos have been created. The first of them is aimed at teachers and its objective is to present the advantages of this installation to teachers through an interactive and collaborative game. To do this, the company has made a full-scale model of the university buildings. The participants of the 'escape room' must work as a team using the tools available within the laboratory and demonstrate their expertise by applying teaching tools to solve the different tests. The second of them is offered to students and its purpose is to show the location of the different facilities and services offered by the university through a collaborative game. Those who participate will discover a secret organization that will propose a series of challenges to solve with juicy rewards. These two activities are part of the set of activities offered in the University Welcome program, but will also be available throughout the academic year.

The UMU collaborates in this campaign promoted by the National Transplant Organization (ONT) and the Josep Carreras Foundation, which seeks to attract potential bone marrow donors between 18 and 40 years old. The chosen motto 'A match for a life' is based on an analogy about the use of applications to find a partner and the difficulties of finding the right one. Thus, the probability of finding a compatible unrelated bone marrow donor worldwide is 1 in 4,000. Healthy Universities Day On the other hand, the University Social Center has also been the scene of the distribution of fruit and vegetables, as part of the actions of the Network of Healthy Universities at the University of Murcia (REUPS). This distribution and tasting of juices has been possible thanks to the courtesy of FECOAM, El Ciruelo and Vía Nature.

The exhibition 'Spanish science before Einstein and relativity' can now be visited at the Espinardo campus of the UMU,"Traveling to the 19 days that one hundred years ago, in 1923, Albert Einstein spent in different Spanish cities and understanding the significance of his contributions is now possible through the exhibition 'Spanish science before Einstein and relativity', inaugurated by the vice-rector of Research of the University of Murcia (UMU), Senena Corbalán, and the president of the Academy of Sciences of the Region of Murcia, Ángel Ferrández. Prior to the inauguration, the curator of the exhibition, Francisco A. González Redondo, professor of History of Science at the Complutense University of Madrid, gave the inaugural lecture on the exhibition that commemorates the visit at the Faculty of Chemistry of the UMU. that the genius of Physics brought to our country a hundred years ago. A receipt signed by Einstein himself The curator of the exhibition explained to those attending the event the route that visitors will be able to take through the 7 showcases and 18 information panels installed in the 'María Moliner' General Library and in the Faculty of Chemistry, both located on the Espinardo campus of the UMU. Among the material on display, stands out a receipt signed by Einstein himself on March 3, 1923 for the lecture he gave at the Central University of Madrid with a remuneration of 4,022.95 pesetas. In addition, images of the events that Einstein starred in during his tour of Spain, publications by Santiago Ramón y Cajal and Leonardo Torres Quevedo and a showcase dedicated to the History of Science at the UMU, among other bibliographic 'jewels', are exhibited. The president of the ACCRM, Ángel Ferrández, highlighted at the opening ceremony “the commitment that the Academy of Sciences of the Region of Murcia makes by financing and organizing this exhibition, which will bring the figure of Einstein and the history of science in Spain”. The vice-rector for Research at the UMU said she felt “excited because when touring this exhibition I have remembered the responsibility that teachers have when it comes to encouraging learning for the sake of learning because that is how revolutionary scientific ideas arise” “I am not a revolutionary” Confirmed in 1922 the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Physics corresponding to 1921, Albert Einstein began a tour of the world that took him to Barcelona on February 23, 1923, with his host, Esteban Terradas. In the Session Room of the Palace of the Provincial Council (current Palace of the Generalitat) he gave a course of three lectures for which he would charge 3,500 pesetas. On Thursday, March 1, he traveled to Madrid. Interviewed on the train for ABC by the Hungarian journalist of Jewish origin Andrés Révész, he made a confession reassuring readers: ""I am not a revolutionary, not even in the scientific field, since I want to preserve as much as possible and I intend to eliminate only what hinders the progress of science."" Einstein was awarded an Honoris Causa Doctorate by the Central University of Madrid, where he also gave the course of three lectures. On Sunday the 4th, King Alfonso XIII presented him with the corresponding academic diploma from the Royal Academy of Sciences. Exact, Physical and Natural. The last scientific meeting of the German genius in the capital would take place on Friday the 9th: a conference-gathering organized by José Ortega y Gasset at the Student Residence. On Sunday, March 11, he left Madrid back for Berlin spending three days in Zaragoza, where he would give two more lectures on Special Relativity and General Relativity in the assembly hall shared by the Faculties of Medicine and Sciences. The stay in Zaragoza was completed with the receipt of the diploma as a corresponding academic from the Academy of Exact, Physical-Chemical and Natural Sciences. “Although few people were able to understand what Einstein explained in his lectures, his visit did achieve a spectacular increase in society's perception of the value of science, undoubtedly due to the extraordinary attention that the press gave it.” , summarized the curator of the exhibition. The exhibition will remain open throughout the month of October, from Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.",4,154
"At the Official Opening Ceremony of the Course, the rector expresses the UMU's regret for the victims of the fire and solidarity with their family and friends.","The rector of the University of Murcia, José Luján, participated this Tuesday in the Official Opening Ceremony of the Course of the Public Universities of the Region of Murcia, held at the Polytechnic University of Cartagena, which this course commemorates the 25 years of its creation. On a day in which the Region of Murcia is in official mourning for the tragedy that occurred over the weekend in Murcia, Luján has not given the institutional speech that he had planned before the event because, he explained, “the best words I can say ""here this morning on behalf of the University of Murcia, the only ones that do not seem indifferent to me are those of regret for the victims of the fire and those of condolence and solidarity with their family and friends."" The rector of the UMU added that since Sunday he has received numerous messages from rectors of universities throughout Spain expressing their love and solidarity with the Region of Murcia. Luján concluded his brief speech by congratulating the Polytechnic University of Cartagena for its 25 years of life and successes and wished a good academic year to the students and staff of both universities.",11,98
The Quality of the UMU Centers is Assured,"This morning a Quality Assurance Manual for the Centers of the University of Murcia was approved in the session of the Governing Council of the University of Murcia. The Internal Quality Assurance System (SAIC) guarantees quality training in the official degrees taught in the university centers/faculties of the UMU. This system responds to the demands of the student body and society through transparent procedures and includes accountability mechanisms. The National Agency for Quality Assessment and Accreditation (ANECA) certifies the implementation of SAIC in university centers through the AUDIT program and, more recently, through the AUDIT-International program. The new version of the SAIC of the UMU centers that has been approved today, includes a manual and a series of procedures that allow adaptation to the AUDIT International program, as well as RD 640/2021 on the creation, recognition and authorization of universities and university centers, and institutional accreditation of said centers. This version has been previously debated and agreed upon in the Quality Commission. The UMU has already certified the implementation of 16 Quality Systems of the 20 planned, after passing the corresponding external audit process and demonstrating adequate compliance with the quality criteria and guidelines established by the evaluation agency. This certification, which has only been obtained so far by the UMU in the Region of Murcia, has allowed it to obtain institutional accreditation for these centers. A fact that represents the recognition of its capacity to guarantee the overall academic quality of each Faculty, ensuring and guaranteeing the renewal of the accreditation of the university degree and master's degrees taught in them for a period of 6 years. University Welcome: a hundred events for everyone Alicia Rubio Bañón, vice-rector for Students and Employment, reported today at the meeting of the Governing Council about the more than a hundred activities that will make up this year's University Welcome of the UMU with which will begin the new academic year 2023-2024. The University Welcome, said the vice-rector, goes ""beyond being a mere act of welcome, it is an open invitation to all citizens to immerse themselves in the rich activities and proposals of the UMU."" The activities will extend throughout the month of October (specifically between the 2nd and the 26th). These activities seek to be a meeting point and a space for dialogue and fun between students, teachers, collaborators and citizens. From theater at the Romea, donation campaigns, tree plantations, charity concerts, macro-concerts, Spanish film days and premieres, to Gastrowelcome, without forgetting a varied sports, theater and innovation offer, and including tournaments, walks or escape rooms. All of this, free or at symbolic prices. Internal Regime of the Attached University School of Nursing of Cartagena Finally, the modifications to the Internal Regime Regulation of the Attached University School of Nursing of Cartagena have also been approved today. These modifications, which had already passed all the procedures for approval, seek to adapt the Regulations to the New University Regulations, as well as to improve the functioning of the Center from an academic point of view.",4,30

"Marine heat waves threaten the survival of a key coral species for the Mediterranean ecosystem, as confirmed by a UMU study","recent study, carried out by the Marine Ecology and Conservation research group of the University of Murcia (UMU), in collaboration with the Spanish Institute of Oceanography, and financed by the Department of Water, Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries of the Region of Murcia , reveals the devastating effect of marine heat waves on the Mediterranean coastal ecosystem and the risk it poses to its species. Scientific work, carried out for more than 15 years, has documented marine heat waves in the waters of the Cabo de Palos - Hormigas Islands Marine Reserve, evaluating their effect on the Mediterranean coral species Eunicella singularis, commonly known as white gorgonian. The results reveal that the mortality rate of this species is 30 times higher than that detected at the beginning of the study, in 2005, and that more than 40% of the gorgonian population that lives on these coasts is affected by necrosis. Among the most important findings is the sharp increase detected in marine heat waves over recent years, both in number, duration and intensity. The record-breaking heat wave in 2018 caused one of the largest mass die-offs ever recorded in the Mediterranean Sea, affecting 75% of the white gorgonian individuals in the marine reserve, killing 12, 5% of the colonies studied. ""At 25 meters deep, where the white gorgonian begins to dominate the underwater landscape, we have recorded a total of 19 heat waves throughout the entire study period. It should be noted that in the period between 2007 and 2014, only two of them, with the remaining 17 concentrating in recent years,” explains UMU professor José Antonio García Charton. These extreme climatic phenomena, characterized by a sudden and marked warming of water, which were once rare, are now increasingly frequent, with devastating effects on underwater life. Evolution and implications “It should be noted that the population of white gorgonians in the reserve has been continuously affected by heat waves from 2014 to the present, exerting continued pressure on the species, generating accumulated damage, making its recovery impossible and reducing its resilience, thus putting at risk the viability of this long-lived species,” explains Víctor Orenes Salazar, first author of the study. The implications of this research go beyond documenting the status and viability of a specific marine species, the white gorgonian. “It cannot be overlooked that the species studied is one of the most important structural and biomass components of one of the most diverse Mediterranean communities, the coralline habitat, which houses approximately 10% of all the species that inhabit the basin. Mediterranean”, concludes García Charton. Therefore, the loss of this long-lived structural component of the coastal seabed represents an unprecedented threat to the identity and functioning of the entire Mediterranean marine ecosystem.

UMU researchers discover that drugs already on the market could have a new use in the treatment of congenital anemias,"The Immunity, Inflammation and Cancer research group at the University of Murcia (UMU), together with the Murcian Institute for Biosanitary Research (IMIB) and CIBERER, has discovered a new molecular pathway that controls the formation of blood cells. This finding has great clinical relevance, since it opens the door to the use of drugs already marketed for new purposes to treat congenital anemias. The specific drug, Nilotinib, is marketed to treat chronic myeloid leukemia. Now, thanks to this study, it could be used for rare diseases such as Blackfan-Diamond anemia (DBA), a pathology that can appear at two months of age and is associated with a lack of red blood cell production. The results have just been published in the prestigious journal EMBO Molecular Medicine, and are part of the work carried out by Lola Rodríguez Ruiz and Juan Manuel Lozano Gil during their respective doctoral theses, and directed by UMU professor Victoriano Mulero Méndez. Starting point There are many chronic inflammatory diseases that usually have associated blood disorders, such as excessive production of white blood cells, called neutrophilia, or low production of red blood cells, that is, anemia. In previous studies by the research group, they had already shown that a set of molecules known as the inflammasome is hyperactivated when there is this chronic inflammation, promoting the appearance of both diseases, neutrophilia and anemia. This mechanism is present in different vertebrates such as zebrafish, used as a model, and humans, but not in mice. On this occasion, they have been able to reveal how the inflammasome called NLRP1 is involved in these blood alterations. Furthermore, “we have discovered the mechanism by which it is activated and regulated in hematopoietic stem cells, which are responsible for producing all the blood cells in the body,” explains UMU Professor of Cellular Biology Victoriano Mulero Méndez. activation is what has revealed a possible therapeutic target that several drugs already approved for clinical use are capable of inhibiting, reversing the excessive production of white blood cells and increasing the production of red blood cells. “Given that Nilotinib is a drug approved by the European Medicines Agency, it is attractive for reuse in the treatment of these hereditary anemias,” continues the UMU researcher. In fact, the UMU, IMIB and CIBERER have requested the granting of a European patent and work is being done from the OTRIs of the institutions involved in licensing it to a pharmaceutical company. This study has been financed mainly by the Seneca Foundation and the State Research Agency, CIBERER-ISCIII, CARM Health Department, and the American DBA Foundation have also contributed.

UMU professor Susana Martínez closes the project to enhance underground heritage in the European Parliament,"This Thursday, September 21, the European Parliament hosted the final conference of the 'Underground4Value' project, which aims to highlight the conservation of European underground heritage, in which 30 countries have participated and in which the University of Murcia has played a prominent role, with Professor Susana Martínez Rodríguez as vice president of this network of specialists. The final exhibition in the European Parliament is a recognition of the good practices carried out in the project and the significance of its actions for the culture and heritage of the European Union. The project is part of the COST actions (acronym for European Cooperation in Science and Technology), which seek to strengthen scientific and technical research in Europe, financing the establishment of collaboration networks between researchers from different countries. The main objectives of this project (Cost Action CA18110) have focused on promoting sustainable approaches to the conservation of underground heritage and harnessing the potential of underground space in the social, economic and cultural spheres. Professors from the Faculty of Economics and Business and the Faculty of Labor Sciences of the UMU have worked on the particular objective of revaluing the underground heritage of the Region of Murcia, especially that of the municipality of La Unión. Throughout the development of the project, the University of Murcia has carried out a debate forum, living lab, and a training school aimed at young researchers and professionals so that they could acquire training on the enhancement of underground heritage to the highest level. level. 'Underground4Value', which started in 2019, has involved field work in more than twenty European places with underground heritage and the impact that these missions have had on the territories has been one of the highlights of the presentation at the European Parliament. In each of the places with an example of relevant underground heritage, an in-depth study was carried out of the conditions of economic viability and, above all, the impact that its enhancement could have for the local community, offering an action plan or improvement. Among the examples studied, well-known cases such as the Dolmen of Antelas (Portugal), the catacombs of San Genaro in Naples (Italy), the Göreme caves (Turkey), or the Mining Park and the Festival del Cante de las Minas de La Unión stand out. . As a result of all the research, the project has published a complete guide that allows you to discover jewels of European underground heritage on its website. Through this 'toolbox', an organized collection of information articulated in a large number of issues is offered where all types of information about European underground heritage can be found. The objective is to offer, through an interactive menu of 62 questions organized in 8 blocks, the tools available to municipalities, local promoters, community leaders and researchers to improve their actions on underground heritage, prioritizing sustainability and improving interaction with local communities. In addition to all these materials, a collection of books on European underground heritage has also been published. More information about the project: https://underground4value.eu/",8,94
study in which the UMU participates observes that the recovery of the biodiversity of European rivers has stalled since 2010,"The article, published in the journal Nature, shows an increase in the diversity of invertebrates in these ecosystems as a consequence of the restoration actions of the 90s and 2000s; but detects that the benefits have slowed down in the last 20 years Researchers from the University of Murcia have participated in an international study that analyzes data that measures the ecological quality of European rivers over the last decades by studying the invertebrates that they inhabit them. The research includes invertebrate data collected in 22 countries from 1986 to 2020 and provides a picture of some biological recovery from historical ecosystem damage, but also indicates that that recovery has stalled since 2010; which points out some pending challenges for its conservation. The results of this complete study have been recently published by the journal Nature. The study observes overall increases in invertebrate species richness (0.73% per year); functional richness, a parameter that measures the diversity of biological and ecological characteristics of species, of 2.4% per year; and abundance, with an increase of 1.17% in the number of individuals per year. “However, these increases occurred mainly before the 2010s and have since stabilized,” explains David Sánchez Fernández, a researcher at the Department of Ecology and Hydrology at the University of Murcia who has participated in the research, along with the UMU researcher Andrés Milan. The fact that these improvements in European river ecosystems occurred before the 2010s indicates that the benefits of interventions carried out in the 1990s and 2000s are running out. Sánchez notes that “the really surprising finding is how this improvement in aquatic biodiversity has slowed over the last 20 years, with little or no change among the many recovery measures developed in the last 5 to 10 years.” To this we must add that new stressors are emerging or existing ones are intensifying. For example, new types of pollutants have been generated, intensive agriculture models are taking hold, and the consequences of climate change appear. These factors could slow down and even reverse progress in the recovery of aquatic biodiversity in Europe, according to the study. The database used for this large report includes evidence from more than 1,800 locations in 22 countries in Europe, with samples collected over more than 50 years; the vast majority post-1990. Rivers and other aquatic ecosystems cover less than 1% of the Earth's surface and yet support a disproportionately high level of biodiversity. Various investigations have found evidence that they are among the most threatened ecosystems in the world, with some of the highest rates of biodiversity loss, linked to a combination of factors, such as intense exploitation by humans, pollution and change. climate. Rivers are some of the best monitored ecosystems, and the invertebrate community that lives in them can be used as a sensitive indicator of the ecological state of rivers.",13,117

The University of Murcia to almost 800 international mobility students this year,"This Tuesday, the University of Murcia held the institutional event to welcome foreign students who begin the academic year in Murcia thanks to international mobility, which in this course will be close to 800. The rector, José Luján, and the mayor, José Ballesta, told them they received in an event that took place at the Romea Theater in Murcia and which was the beginning of a week of activities organized by the UMU International Relations Area for these students to get to know the city and the Region. The majority belong to the Erasmus+ Studies program, with 538 foreigners received in our classrooms in this first semester, a figure that will increase with the arrival of 250 students in the month of January. On behalf of the UMU, 713 students will study at the more than 500 European partner universities. To these we must add those who participate in other mobility programs. The activity flows with Latin America occur mainly under the Exchange with Latin America ILA program, in which 65 Murcia students will participate and will receive an aid of 2,000 euros, financed by the University of Murcia and Banco Santander. For this same program and for the first semester, the University of Murcia 75 Latin American students at the UMU. Likewise, there are agreements with the Carolina Foundation through which the UMU receives 4 master's students. Mobility with the United States is carried out mainly through the ISEP Program with 9 students leaving and 20 arriving, to which are added 9 students sent and 9 received from universities through the Bilateral Agreements program, to universities such as Oregon State University, Bowling Green State University, Simpson College or Millikin University. Within this same program, from Asian countries, 3 students from Taiwan will arrive through the agreement with Tamkang University and 4 from Korea from Keimyung University, a university to which 2 UMU students will travel. The Erasmus+ International Mobility Program with third countries (KA171) allows this course to receive 24 students from different countries outside the EU, such as Armenia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Colombia, Georgia, Guatemala, Ukraine, Uruguay, and Venezuela. However, more students will have the opportunity to study at the UMU during the second semester once the call for vacant places for that period has ended. On the other hand, under the Erasmus+ Internship Program in this first semester, 15 students will leave in the first of the 4 phases of this call, and it is expected that throughout the course up to a hundred UMU students will travel to carry out stays in companies and European universities.

The University of Murcia and Cajamar renew their collaboration to promote student employment,"The University of Murcia and Cajamar have signed this Tuesday the renewal of the collaboration agreement by which the entity finances activities and reports of the institution aimed at promoting the employment of students. The rector, José Luján, and Bartolomé Viudez, Executive Councilor of Cajamar, were in charge of signing the agreement in an event held at the Convalescence. Thanks to the renewal of this agreement, the University of Murcia, through the Employment Guidance and Information Center (COIE), will carry out this course the Labor Insertion Study corresponding to the promotions that completed their studies in the years 2020 and 2021. In addition, a new edition of the UMU EMPLOYER FEST will be held, an event in which students and companies come into contact and that last year allowed companies and institutions in the Region to receive 14,000 resumes from students looking for their first contracts. The collaboration between the UMU and Cajamar also facilitates the holding of contests and activities to guide students in their successful job search. One of these actions is the 'Cajamar Contest for the best resume', which seeks to promote creativity and the use of innovative resources when developing one of the basic instruments in the active search for employment. “Knowing what happens to students once they have finished their studies is key for us. Know where they are working, if they are happy and if their studies adapt to what companies need,” explained the vice-rector for Students and Employment, Alicia Rubio. The rector, for his part, thanked Cajamar for its financial collaboration, which makes it easier for the University of Murcia to carry out essential activities to improve the public service provided by the institution.",8,66
The University of Murcia simplifies access to car parks with its mobile application and geolocation,"This year, the University of Murcia has simplified access for students and staff to both campus facilities and parking; since from now on it will not be necessary to use the physical university card (TUI), although this option is still available. Access to car parks can be done automatically by reading the vehicle license plate or access via geolocation. The license plate reading system allows the automatic opening of parking barriers by recognizing the vehicle's license plate, as long as it has been previously registered through the University of Murcia mobile application or on the digital services access platform. 'My campus'. Another way to access parking lots is by opening barriers directly from your mobile phone, through geolocation. To do it this way, it is simply necessary for the vehicle to position itself in front of the barrier and select the 'Open Parking' option in the UMUApp. Currently, this system is available in the following parking lots: Health Sciences park and ride, Faculty of Biology, Giner de los Ríos Classroom, Faculty of Chemistry and Rector Soler Building. The intention is to gradually incorporate this service in the rest of the University's car parks. These changes, included in the Digital Transformation strategy of the University of Murcia, also allow students, teachers and staff to identify themselves and access university facilities through their mobile application. This application is a key tool in the development of academic activity for students, since it allows you to enter the Virtual Classroom, receive important alerts, consult the class schedule, check email, among other functionalities. This course also allows access to university spaces. With just a click you can access the gym, the Merced campus or the bicycle parking lots, for which it was previously necessary to use a physical card, although this option is still available. These new services are designed to offer a faster and more comfortable access service and are a clear reflection of the commitment to the Digital Transformation of the University of Murcia and the constant improvement of its infrastructure.",7,75

The new UMU and Zukán Chair develops probiotic foods to improve the well-being of bees,"The University of Murcia and the company Zukán have signed this Wednesday the agreement that launches the Zukán Chair of research and development of nutrition for bees, a project that represents another step to strengthen the research collaboration that they have maintained since 2016. the UMU and the company, based in Molina de Segura. Among the central lines of research of this chair is the development of probiotic foods to improve the well-being of bees; which results in the quality of the honey and the benefit for the beekeeping industry. The offer of specialization courses in nutrition for beekeeping professionals and students is another of the objectives of this chair. Pilar de la Rúa, professor of Zoology at the UMU and promoter of the chair, explained the importance of caring for bees, which are an indispensable element in ecosystems and in human nutrition, thanks to their role in pollination. “They feed on nectar, which they transform into honey, and we collect that honey for our consumption. That is why we have to reinforce their food if we take away theirs and, also, whenever possible, give them the best food. The bees must feed in the field, but sometimes they can't always because they encounter difficulties and it is important to complement their diet,"" explained the researcher during the signing of the agreement for the creation of the chair, which took place in Convalescence. Thanks to the research collaboration between the UMU and Zukán, foods with probiotics are being developed to ensure this better nutrition and so that ""the bees have vitality and also better resistance to the pathogens that can be found or even to adversities such as high temperatures."" temperatures or lack of water,” De la Rúa pointed out. For his part, Marcos Sáez, executive director of Zukán, has emphasized the importance of the dissemination of research results in the beekeeping sector, something that will be the central objective of this chair. “We are all aware of the importance of taking care of bees, but few do anything and that is why all the knowledge we generate thanks to the collaboration with the University of Murcia is so important and bringing that knowledge to many people,” said Sáez; who is convinced that this transfer of knowledge will contribute to modernizing the beekeeping sector; as well as creating a pool of workers for companies in the sector. The rector, José Luján, has also highlighted that this new chair is an example ""of the contribution of the University of Murcia to the productive fabric of the Region thanks to the collaboration with companies that trust in our research and transfer work.""",2,12

The G9 shows its concern about the regulatory development of the LOSU,"The rector of the University of Murcia, José Luján, attended this Monday in Pamplona the meeting of the General Assembly of Rectors of the universities that make up the G9 group. It is this assembly, in which the Public University of Navarra (UPNA) has assumed the presidency of the G9, the group has shown its solidarity with the people of Morocco and with its higher education institutions. In this sense, it has become clear that the collaboration with Moroccan universities maintained by the G-9 through the country's CPU (Conférence des Prèsidents D'Université) will be resumed as soon as the situation allows it. On the other hand, the assembly has shown its concern about the regulatory deployment of the Organic Law of the University System (LOSU), in particular about the financing necessary to comply with the commitments of said law. Likewise, the report regarding the activities of the G-9 shared digital campus, whose director is UPNA professor David Benito Pertusa, has also been released. The latter has indicated that the new “online” training offer for teaching staff, PAS and doctoral students will increase its number of places by 25% from 2024.

The UMU enters the 'top 25' of the world debate championship in Spanish,"team from the University of Murcia has achieved a historic place in the prestigious World University Debate Championship in Spanish (CMUDE), held in Panama City and organized by the Technological University of Panama. CMUDE has an important history, since it was born in 2011, and has become the largest and most important Spanish-speaking debate competition among university students, aiming to promote oratory, argumentation and critical thinking skills. The contest is based on the British parliamentary format. The 2023 edition was held from July 13 to 20 and attracted more than 140 teams and 280 speakers from around the world. The pair of debaters from the University of Murcia, formed by Nacho Fenollar Portillo and Carmen Puente Nieto, achieved a position among the 25 best in the world in the qualifying rounds, a significant milestone that places the UMU among the outstanding institutions in the art of debate. Along with them, Cristóbal Alcaraz García, also from the University of Murcia, participated as a judge in the tournament and was close to qualifying in his own category, having the opportunity to evaluate some of the best debaters in the world. The results are interesting if we consider that Puente and Alcaraz have been in the Debate Club of the University of Murcia for only one year, a significantly shorter period of time compared to the usual preparation of participants in this type of competitions, which which can mean continuing to obtain important achievements in the future. The trip to Panama was possible thanks to the support of the University of Murcia and the Regional Assembly, reflecting their commitment to promoting debate skills, as well as the personal and professional growth of students from the Region of Murcia. The achievement of these students underlines the quality of teaching and the University of Murcia's dedication to developing debating and critical thinking skills, putting it firmly on the map as a center of excellence in this field.",2,23
The UMU organizes a conference on the opportunities that digitalization offers when it comes to promoting fishing in the Mediterranean,"The University of Murcia organizes this Friday, September 8, the conference 'Opportunities of digitalization for the enhancement of fishing in the Mediterranean', which will take place at the Águilas Fishermen's Market. This session is part of the Digipesca project, directed by the Polytechnic University of Valencia and of which the University of Murcia is a part; and has the collaboration of the ThinkinAzul project - the joint research and innovation strategy to protect marine ecosystems against climate change and pollution - and the Fishermen's Guild. In the Digipesca project, a multidisciplinary and inter-university network of professionals is carrying out an important analysis of the degree of digitalization of the fishing sector, since the implementation of technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) or the Internet of Things (IoT) should allow the processes associated with the activity to be improved and made more efficient. Publicizing all the progress made in this regard so far and encouraging the exchange of experiences for the design of new formulas potentially applicable to each area and its particularities is the objective of the conference 'Opportunities of digitalization for the enhancement of fishing in the Mediterranean'. The day will start at 9:30 a.m. and will end at 6:00 p.m. It will have the participation of researchers and fishermen belonging to the organizing and collaborating entities. In addition, it will also include a guided tour of the Lonja de Águilas and the fish auction included in the event's programming. The studies on the digitalization of the fishing sector promoted by Digipesca are presented as a solution to the crisis in the sector, since they are closely linked to other aspects and lines of research that influence fishing processes, which must be considered. and addressed. Reason why in this project, in a parallel and interdependent manner, an active search for new marketing and valorization strategies for the Mediterranean fishing product is being carried out. Digipesca is financed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food through NextGeneration funds within the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan.

study by the UMU and the College of Economists reveals that 50 percent of Murcia residents would pay more for products from socially responsible companies,"The Chair of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) of the University of Murcia (UMU) and the Official College of Economists of the Region of Murcia have presented the study 'Consumer perception of CSR in the Region of Murcia in 2023', which shows that 49.9% of Murcians would pay more for products from socially responsible companies. This figure represents a growth of 12.7% in the last 15 years. This work has measured the evolution of consumer perception of CSR since 2008, and it is the fifth analysis carried out by UMU researchers. The research also reveals that 61.4% of those surveyed are “increasingly more informed and aware of what CSR is, which they attribute to the commitment that companies acquire with society.” The work focuses on four areas: the degree of knowledge of Murcian society about concepts such as CSR, Sustainability or the SDGs, the behavior of consumers regarding the CSR actions of companies and their purchasing criteria, the role they attribute to companies in CSR and the perception of Murcian companies and, finally, the responsible behavior of Murcians. 'Ranking' of responsible companies The study once again places ElPozo Alimentación as the Murcian company that consumers identify as the most responsible (25.1%), followed by Estrella de Levante (14.7%) and Hero España (13. 9%). Behind them are Disfrimur, Hefame, Aguas de Murcia and Soltec. These are organizations dedicated to satisfying the needs of their main interest groups: clients, consumers, workers, suppliers, capital, institutions and society in general, where Social Responsibility is one of their business pillars. More than half of consumers (53.1%) consider that in recent years companies in the Region “care more about society and the environment,” compared to 24.5% who believe that “they do not worry more” and 22.4% who “worry the same”. Regarding the “most important” practices that companies should implement in terms of CSR, respondents placed the improvement of the situation of employees in first place (9 out of 10), followed by work-life balance (8.8 out of 10). ), the adoption of environmental measures (8.6 out of 10), as well as promoting social inclusion among its employees (8.5 out of 10). An independent work of Anma Research The research has been coordinated by the director of the UMU CSR Chair, Longinos Marín, together with the deputy director of the UMU CSR Chair, Pedro J. Cuestas, in a work team formed by the researchers from the Department of Marketing and Market Research Mª Carmen Alarcón, Inés López, Manuela López and Salvador Ruiz de Maya. While the field work has been carried out by the Murcian market research company Anma Research. The event was chaired by the rector of the UMU, José Luján, and the vice dean of the College of Economists, Patricio Rosas. In the presentation of the study, the vice-rector of Social Responsibility and Culture of the UMU, Longinos Marín, celebrated that “Murcians are increasingly more and better informed and sensitized in the field of CSR, Sustainability or the SDGs and, what More importantly, determined to transfer all that knowledge to their purchasing decisions.” Marín thanked the attending companies and institutions for their support of the UMU CSR Chair over the last 12 years, which is based on three pillars: research, dissemination and awareness-raising and training. “This study is linked to the second pillar and the results obtained show that Murcian consumers identify Social Responsibility as a generator of value and business reputation in organizations,” he commented. For his part, Patricio Rosas Martínez, Vice Dean of the College of Economists, assured that “CSR is a key tool to increase the competitiveness of companies. Our Region is a clear example of this. The leading companies, most valued by citizens, best managed and that carry out all their activity in a global market, reflect this in their growth."" And he also specified that ""Corporate Social Responsibility increases the main asset of exporting companies: its good reputation. Today it is unfeasible to be in international markets without respecting good practices in employment, the environment, occupational health, the fight against corruption, and, of course, ensuring the interests of consumers."" Commitment to CSR Finally, the rector of the UMU, José Luján, highlighted the UMU's commitment to sustainability and thanked again the support of the companies and institutions present, which support a Chair that promotes the Master in CSR, which ""this year reaches its XI edition after training more than 180 professionals who practice CSR in the main companies and institutions of the Region"", he concluded.

UMU researcher Fabio Juliá receives 1.5 million for the development of drugs and other compounds in a more sustainable and 'cheaper' way,"Fabio Juliá Hernández, researcher at the Department of Inorganic Chemistry at the University of Murcia (UMU), has just received one of the prestigious 'Starting Grants' projects awarded by the European Research Council (ERC). The project is endowed with 1.5 million euros that will be used to create new, more economical and sustainable chemical reactions that can be useful for the development of medicines and other compounds with high added value, vital for social well-being. As the UMU researcher explains, “until now the chemical reactions used in the production of drugs that cure our diseases, technological elements in smartphones, or agrochemicals that facilitate the livelihood of an increasingly growing population, use precious metals like palladium, which are scarce and very expensive.” This poses a risk to the viability of these products for future generations. Instead, Fabio Juliá proposes the use of other materials present in greater availability in nature, such as iron, which is the most abundant metal in the universe and, therefore, a cheap, inexhaustible and non-toxic source. . Their proposal consists of trying to activate iron catalysts with the light energy itself so that they are capable of creating chemical reactions similar to those currently carried out by precious metals, and even others that are not possible until now. “We hope that this can lead to more sustainable alternatives from an economic and environmental point of view,” highlights Juliá. Elite research The 'Starting Grants' call has become one of the most prestigious research programs in the world, highly competitive and open to candidates of any nationality. With an endowment of 1.5 million euros, they allow young researchers to develop ambitious, innovative and extremely excellent projects over the next five years. To get here, Fabio Juliá earned his doctorate at the UMU studying the photophysical and photochemical properties of organometallic compounds. After spending time at the University of Manchester, the German Max-Planck Institute and the Chemical Research Institute of Catalonia (ICIQ) in Tarragona, this year 2023 he returned to the ranks of the UMU as a Ramón y Cajal researcher.",14,26

'THE Impact Rankings' places the UMU as a national leader in its promotion of the SDGs,"The University of Murcia (UMU) has once again placed itself in the 101-200 range in the world in terms of its commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), according to the prestigious sustainability classification 'THE Impact Rankings'. ' 2023, prepared by the British institution Times Higher Education (THE). In this way, for the second consecutive year, it is at the top of the higher education institutions that contribute the most to the fulfillment of the SDGs on a global scale. This classification evaluates the social impact of higher education institutions and measures their contribution to the development of the 2030 Agenda and the 17 SDGs on an individual basis. In this edition, a total of 1,591 universities from 112 countries have been presented, of which 47 are Spanish. For the first time, UMU ranks among the world's top 100 higher education institutions in five of the 17 SDGs. Specifically, it ranks 60th in promoting SDG 1 'End of poverty', 96th in SDG 8 'Decent work and economic growth', 88th in SDG 13 'Climate action', 61st in SDG 14 'Life below water' and obtains its best ranking in the promotion of SDG 15 'Life on land', where it ranks 54th in the world. The work of the Social Care Office 'THE Impact Rankings' highlights the UMU's anti-poverty programs that, through the Social Care Office, help students in situations of economic or social vulnerability. This platform, launched in 2021 due to the impact of Covid-19, has helped more than 500 people from the university community. This is an innovative student support service that guarantees greater equality of opportunities and mainly eliminates economic obstacles for students to continue with their degree, master's or doctoral studies. At the same time, and within the assessment of this SDG 1, this ranking has also rewarded the research work of the Social Exclusion Observatory. Promotion of employability The promotion of employability and the progress of university students for their job promotion through curricular practices is one of the keys to the UMU also obtaining the 'excellent' in SDG 8 'Decent work and growth economic'. While environmental education measures allow it to be at the forefront in terms of contributing to SDG 13 in the fight against climate change. Regarding SDG 14 'Life underwater', the public university of Murcia is ranked 66th in the world thanks to its awareness campaigns for water saving, as well as its commitment to the sustainability of underwater flora and fauna through of the UMU Aquarium. This center develops maintenance and reproduction protocols for threatened species, particularly in the flora and fauna of the Mar Menor. In this field, they have achieved the reproduction of fish and invertebrates, Mediterranean and tropical, in species such as sharks, syngnathids, corals, bivalves or crustaceans. Finally, 'THE Impact Rankings' 2023 also highlights education measures on ecosystem protection within the framework of SDG 15 'Life on Earth'. ODSesiones: educate in the 2030 Agenda With the aim of raising awareness about the importance of sustainability in the university community and Murcian society, since 2019 the Vice-Rector for Social Responsibility and Culture of the UMU, led by Longinos Marín, launched ODSesiones. This is a public-private project that has the support of Aguas de Murcia, CaixaBank, the Cajamurcia Foundation and the regional government that has organized more than 700 activities since its launch, in which nearly 32,000 people have participated, in mostly UMU students. In its history, ODSesiones has accumulated three awards, granted by the ONCE Foundation, the media 'Corresponsables' and the Union of Associated Work Cooperatives of the Region of Murcia (Ucomur). Another of its milestones has been participation in the COP25 Climate Summit, as well as in the last two editions of the 'International Congress on Sustainable Development', organized by Columbia University in New York. This innovative initiative that educates on the 2030 Agenda has been taken into account by Times Higher Education evaluators with regard to SDG 17 'Partnerships for the goals'. In this SDG the UMU obtains its highest score -81 points-, but it occupies the rank of between 201-300 universities since all higher education institutions that apply for this classification must compulsorily attend this SDG that demonstrates collaboration between different actors to advance sustainability: governments, private sector and civil society, exchanging knowledge, technical capacity, technology and resources. The UMU, also at the forefront in transparency In 'THE Impact Rankings', participating universities must provide the data required for the evaluation of compliance with a minimum of three SDGs, in addition to SDG 17. In this sense, the UMU carries out periodically undertake work to collect data and update its transparency portal, where the UMU as a public administration is accountable for its main actions and offers public and accessible information to citizens. A work that deserved recognition last year as the most transparent university in Spain according to the DYNTRA platform. The Australians, world leaders At the national level, the UMU shares first place in 'THE Impact Rankings' along with eight other Spanish universities, which are Barcelona, Girona, Jaén, Polytechnic of Valencia, Rovira i Virgili, Valencia and Vigo. At the regional level, UCAM occupies position 401-600, while the Polytechnic University of Cartagena has not yet participated in this classification. At a global level, Western Sydney University (Australia) repeats for the second consecutive year as the most sustainable, followed by the University of Manchester (United Kingdom) and Queen's University (Canada), followed by Sains Malaysia (Malaysia) and Tasmania ( Australia).",8,37
UMU researchers convert the Region of Murcia into a conservation area for sharks and rays,"Two joint proposals from the University of Murcia, the University of Alicante, the Spanish Institute of Oceanography and the Cartagena Oceanographic Research Institute ensure that the coast of Murcia and Alicante becomes a conservation area for sharks and rays (Important Shark and Ray Area - ISRA). for its importance in the ecosystem and scientific. These have just been accepted by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the first systematic mapping in history of important areas for sharks and rays in the Mediterranean. Researchers have managed to demonstrate the relevance of these areas for the survival of this group of species in the Mediterranean after arduous months of research work, information collection and scrutiny by a panel of external experts. So much so that of the more than 110 initial ISRA proposals, only 65 have been accepted throughout the Mediterranean. The approved ISRAs include the Murcian coastal strip from San Pedro del Pinatar to Calblanque and a deep sector between the south of Alicante and the Seco de Palos. Proposals The proposal for the shallowest area, located between San Pedro del Pinatar and Calblanque, has been led by María Pozo-Montoro, researcher in the UMU Marine Ecology and Conservation group and responsible for the coordination of both proposals. The coastal coastal strip that goes from land to 80 meters deep and that includes the marine reserve of fishing interest of Cabo de Palos – Islas Hormigas, has been evident thanks to the citizen collaboration of divers, fishermen and bathers of the zone. His photos have been fundamental in demonstrating the importance of the area as a breeding and aggregation area for rays that have disappeared in other enclaves of the Mediterranean and are in critical danger of extinction, such as the guitarfish, the mantelina, the common eagle and the stingray. On the other hand, the second proposal has been led by Professor Francisca Giménez Casalduero, Professor of Marine Sciences and Director of CIMAR at the University of Alicante. This area ranges from 300 meters to 800 meters deep and includes mountains and unique underwater formations such as Seco de Palos or El Planazo and a field of pockmarks – depressions in the seabed resulting from gas emanations and the escape of fluids generated. due to the volcanic activity in the area. This space is especially relevant as a breeding area for deep-sea sharks such as the hairy lantern shark and is an aggregation area for the star ray, a species endemic to the Mediterranean. The main objective of the ISRAs is to put on the international map those key areas for the survival of these species that are at risk of disappearing in the Mediterranean in the absence of immediate action. However, they are not a management figure and therefore do not carry any regulations for the protection of the species involved. “This is the first step to ensure that this area continues to be an oasis for sharks and rays in the Mediterranean,” highlights María Pozo, “This information is more pertinent than ever as we approach 2030, the date on which countries of the world, including Spain, have committed to protecting at least 30% of their seas.” Despite the undeserved bad reputation of these species, largely due to the “Spielberg myth”, scientific data shows that more than 50% of shark and ray species in the Mediterranean are at high risk of extinction due to overfishing. The consequences of the disappearance of sharks and rays from the oceans offer an unpredictable scenario with possible impacts on human activities, due to the important role they play in the ecosystem. Sharks and rays have a decisive influence as predators at the top of food webs, as well as the maintenance of the structural diversity of marine ecosystems.

The Murcian Juan Sánchez wins the XXIII Painting Prize of the University of Murcia,"The University of Murcia has awarded the XXIII Painting Prize in favor of Juan Ángel Sánchez Abellán from Murcia, who was the winner among the 150 participants who participated in this edition, a number that doubles that of candidates for the previous edition. The prize, organized in collaboration with the Murcia City Council and the Fuentes Vicente Foundation, has a prize of 5,000 euros and has been awarded to the work Park Royal Pattern nº5. The work is part of the Park Royal Pattern series, which focuses attention on the subjective perception of the environment of an industrial estate. The utilitarian activity of this polygon, like the machinery that rolls on the asphalt - leaving remains in the form of dark stains or chemical smells -, has echoes in the forms that find their space in this series of paintings created by the Murcian author. The materialization of the winning painting begins with the measurement and tracing of two horizontal lines, made with graphite pencil – one a few centimeters from the upper margin and another at the same distance from the lower margin, and continues with the staining of the space between these lines, made with watercolor to create a slight veil. On this work, a series of actions are carried out that consist of covering part of the surface of the painting with tape to place the black acrylic paint on the uncovered areas. This tape is carelessly removed while the paint is still fresh, with the aim of causing uncontrolled pictorial signs. This way of working causes, on the one hand, a link between the careful selection of materials and their quality, such as Belgian linen, graphite pencil, watercolor and acrylic paint, organized on the surface of the paintings. . And, on the other hand, the meticulous arrangement of the taping, after measuring and dividing the surface through simple mathematical operations, such as the use of axes of symmetry, with the crude application of paint, what is finally articulated is the removal of the tapes bodywork stained with undried paint. First Prize for Artistic Production On the other hand, the University of Murcia has also failed the I Prize for Artistic Production and Research, organized by the collaboration of the Institute of Cultural Industries of the Region of Murcia (ICA). The jury has awarded this prize in its first edition to the project 'The Bearded Woman', presented by the author Helena García Martínez, student of the Master of Artistic Production and Management. This award will allow the artist to develop her project and exhibit it at the University of Murcia. The project should be completed by December 31, 2023.",12,167

The rector, José Luján; and the mayor of Lorca, Fulgencio Gil, in the exercise of his position as the new president of the Foundation, signed the agreement for this renewal of the chair; agreement in which Pilar Jaén and Manolo Jódar have acted as promoters. The agreement, in force since January 2017 and extended in 2021, will maintain the central actions of this chair, dedicated to research, teaching and the transfer to society of all the knowledge that is generated at the Socio-Health Campus of Lorca and that It is especially focused on caring for the elderly. Rector Luján highlighted that the renewal of this agreement “demonstrates the commitment of the University of Murcia and the city of Lorca to research in a field as important as gerontology.” Furthermore, Luján emphasized the importance of “having united avant-garde and originality in a singular and unique project in all of Spain, because nowhere is teaching, research and transfer dedicated exclusively to gerontology concentrated on a campus; “We are building something that is going to be very useful for Lorca and the City of Lorca.” The Chair has a training aspect in which the original activities intended for students and teachers will continue; as well as research. In addition, the Chair carries out very important assistance work that will continue and increase. Starting in September, the Poncemar Foundation will put into operation in Lorca the Service for the Promotion of Personal Autonomy and Prevention of Dependency, a service accredited by the IMAS with an essentially preventive purpose. It should be noted that it also provides home help services, memory workshops and gerontogymnastics, in the urban center and districts. One of its objectives is for its care centers to become research centers in elderly care. In this sense, today, they are developing: - The PHARAON Project, with the Murcian Health Service and the Yecla Technology Center. European project for the promotion of healthy and active aging. - The ADDIM Project, with the Polytechnic University of Cartagena, aimed at assisting older people at home, based on robotics and artificial intelligence, which uses the adapted apartment of the Poncemar Center on Campus. Likewise, these centers are also social-health professional training centers, with FP DUAL students, in its social-health branch of the Integrated Vocational Training Center of Lorca; rotating among them - in the next fiscal year - geriatric nursing residents, these Day Centers being the only ones accredited for this training in the Region. Starting in October, training workshops will be scheduled for health professionals in the Murcia Health Service Area to improve care for chronicity and aging. One of the activities that the University of Experience is having a lot of impact, a training and cultural activity in which people linked to the University of Murcia, retired or close to retirement, hold exhibitions in the socio-health field, aimed at both Campus students of Lorca as well as citizens in general.

The UMU will investigate how ultra-processed foods affect the development of fatty liver in children and young people,"Rubén López Nicolás, professor of Nutrition and Bromatology at the University of Murcia, has received a research grant in the XIII Research Awards, awarded by the ASISA Foundation Chair and the European University of Madrid, thanks to the project The role of ultra-processed foods in the metabolic disease of associated fatty liver in the child and adolescent population, led by López Nicolás himself and carried out jointly by the Faculty of Social and Health Sciences of the Lorca Campus, the Rafael Méndez hospital and the San Diego health center, both located in the Lorca municipality. With this research they aim to obtain information about the effect that the consumption of ultra-processed products, such as industrial pastries, sugary drinks or pre-cooked foods, has on health during the growth stage. Specifically, it is about finding out how these types of bad nutritional habits can favor the development of fat in the liver from a very early age, given that it has been proven that, in addition to being foods rich in fats and sugars, they have other ingredients that favor the development of this pathology. Currently, more than 100 volunteers from health area III have already been recruited to participate in this study, who will be monitored, although preliminary results already indicate a high incidence of this pathology in the population under study. In the future of the project they hope to be able to expand the collection of the number of samples from patients in the Region. The results they hope to obtain, as the researcher explains, ""could improve the approach to the disease in children and adolescents, and especially the harm that the consumption of this type of food brings to health."" The scholarship is endowed with a budget of €6,000 that will be allocated entirely to the study and will allow the research team to consolidate this new line of research.",2,123
"UMU professor Pilar Garrido, Elissa Didòn award by UNESCO for her scientific work in favor of Mediterranean culture","Pilar Garrido Clemente, professor of Arab and Islamic studies at the University of Murcia (UMU), has been recognized with the Elissa Didòn Prize, awarded by the Tyr Foundation, as the female Laureate of the North of the Mediterranean. This recognition is granted for his “scientific career and his concern for the Arab world and its integration,” as the organization highlights. The Tyr Foundation was founded at UNESCO by Dr Maha El-Khalil Chalabi after serious threats from wars to the heritage of the city of Tyr, southern Lebanon. With the aim of creating a chain of international solidarity, renewing ancestral ties and consolidating a horizon of permanent exchanges, this award was born that recognizes two laureates from both shores of the Mediterranean: one from the North and one from the South. This well-deserved distinction rewards Pilar Garrido Clemente for her scientific studies in favor of promoting multiculturalism and making known the thoughts of the philosopher from Al Andalus in her latest book: Complete Work of the Sufi Ibn Masarra of Córdoba or for leading the European project Evaluating Campaigns against Hate (ECO) to combat Islamophobia on social networks.

The UMU completes the installation of its own 5G network on the Campus and tests the improvement of the performance of applications in moving vehicles,"The University of Murcia has completed the installation of its own private 5G network on the Espinardo Campus. It is an experimental platform designed to build a communications network that supports research and innovation activities that allow establishing what is known as an Intelligent Campus or 'Smart Campus'. This great project begins to consolidate after the installation of two prototypes of distributed telematics technology from the companies Bosonit and NEC, which arrived last February at the University of Murcia after the public call of the CDTI, dependent on the Ministry of Science and Innovation ; with the collaboration of the Autonomous Community and with the participation of FEDER Funds. This installation adds to a previous deployment that already provided the campus with a self-managed private 5G network built on free technologies, which operates in a radio frequency band provided by the MASMOVIL group. After the completion of this phase, the University of Murcia becomes one of the few Spanish universities to have its own experimental 5G network. The Intelligent Systems and Telematics research group, led by Professor Antonio Skarmeta, is responsible for the development and exploitation of this deployment and throughout the month of June they have been testing this 5G network on the Espinardo Campus and its performance to establish systems intelligent transportation. Specifically, the research group is testing ways to improve the performance of vehicle applications and services that require connectivity so that this connection remains stable and the transmission of data to the cloud is reliable and uninterrupted. One of the promises of 5G is to add robustness to this type of communications so that users are always guaranteed certain capabilities of the 5G network. The work in which the group led by Skarmeta is immersed also investigates the deployment of a midpoint between the vehicle and the cloud, known as 'edge', which allows true efficient management of the data transmitted from the vehicle. . This intermediate jump allows the creation of virtual copies of the data at a local point and are able to follow the movement of the vehicle. In this way, any cloud application that wants to access vehicle data can request it directly from its digital twin, which will have an updated copy of it and will be able to serve it in a much faster and more efficient way, improving the overall performance of the vehicle. the entire system. In addition, the Espinardo Campus network has also been used to deploy high definition (4K) video retransmission applications resistant to coverage losses and performance drops. This system will achieve more efficient use of devices that require 5G and greater data management capacity to make decisions in the context of the Smart Campus. In the future, for example, the connection of building air conditioning services with traffic data in the campus environment could be linked, since the entry time of staff could be taken into account depending on traffic jams or other circumstances. All the results obtained have demonstrated the usefulness of this type of services and the advantages provided by their deployment in next-generation 5G networks. Among other future demonstrations, the University of Murcia is working to improve mobility applications with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to predict vehicle movements between base stations and is also preparing to deploy similar use cases, but using drones in instead of cars. These demonstrations will take place in the coming months as use cases of the national projects R3CAV and UNICO5G-CERBERUS and the European project NANCY. Furthermore, as part of the European 5GASP research project, in which the Murcian company Odin Solutions collaborates, the aim is to create an open platform that allows the deployment and validation of applications that make use of the 5G network in a simple way. In the context of Smart Campus research, the UMU is committed to reducing its carbon footprint through energy savings. For this reason, it is also planned that in future phases measures will be applied such as using its growing network of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, which will monitor and control the energy use of its buildings, which will help grow the University IoT ecosystem in a stable manner. Improvements will also be implemented in traffic management and parking within the Campus, in addition to other services currently in the development phase.",14,102
UMU researchers help trace the origin and evolution of the virus that most influences the disappearance of the honey bee,"An international investigation in which the “Animal Phylogeny and Evolution” research group of the University of Murcia (UMU) participates has been able to reconstruct the origin and dispersal routes of one of the viruses with the greatest impact and mortality in the bee of the Honey. This is the deformed wing virus (DWV), one of the most important causes of the unstoppable decline of the species. According to the results, globalization has favored the spread of this virus since its first appearance in East Asia in the mid-20th century. As its name indicates, this pathogen affects the wings of the insect, which loses its ability to fly. However, its symptoms go further and can affect the bees' neurological system, which even causes memory loss. The results, which have just been published in the prestigious journal PNAS, reveal for the first time how the virus evolved. All the data obtained indicate that the first cases occurred in East Asia and spread throughout the world after the mites of the Varroa destructor species, transmitters of the virus, became an invasive species and began to parasitize bees. of Western honey (honeycombs) in the mid-20th century. More recently, these bees acquired strain B, probably outside Asia, this being its most deadly variant and the one that has been replacing variant A. Associated with globalization The results presented by the UMU demonstrate how the transmission routes associated Globalization has facilitated the spread of viruses from one species to another “with devastating consequences, especially in the case of honey bees,” as highlighted by University of Murcia researcher Pilar de la Rúa. Varroa mites are responsible for the transmission of various RNA viruses after having changed hosts from eastern to western honey bees (from the species Apis cerana to Apis mellifera). However, these same mites provide the opportunity to study how these diseases are transmitted around the globe; diseases whose origin and spread were still unknown. “Through a phylogeographic analysis, based on data from the whole genome of the virus, we discovered that, rather than reappearing in Western bees, as previous work suggested, DWV-A most likely originated in East Asia and spread. spread in the middle of the last century,” says De la Rúa. “A massive expansion in the population size of this virus has also been observed after the varroa host change,” says Irene Muñoz, co-author of the work. As for strain B, it was most likely acquired more recently from a source outside of East Asia, as it appears absent in the original host of the varroa A. cerana. These results highlight the dynamic nature of viral adaptation, whereby host switching, that is, jumping from one species to another, can lead to pandemics of competing and increasingly virulent diseases. The evolutionary novelty and rapid global spread of these interactions, along with the spread observed in other species, “illustrate how increasing globalization poses urgent threats to biodiversity and food security,” concludes researcher Pilar de La Rúa.

"Night people are more prone to emotional eating and obesity, according to a study by the University of Murcia","If after a stressful day a person's first impulse is to come home and eat sweets or go on a binge as a way to escape, it is probably because we are dealing with an emotional eater. And what is emotional eating? Well, eating an excessive amount of food, not out of hunger, but in response to our emotions, mainly negative emotions (stress, anxiety, boredom, etc.). This is something that different studies have been pointing out for years, but a recent investigation led by the professor at the University of Murcia Marta Garaulet points out data that indicates that those people who are “owl type” means that they have a nocturnal or evening chronotype that makes them maintain Higher levels of activity in the last hours of the day and falling asleep late are more likely to be emotional eaters and, therefore, are more likely to develop obesity. Until now, previous studies by Professor Garaulet's team, most of them carried out in collaboration with research groups linked to Harvard University, had shown that nocturnal or evening people are more obese than morning people; However, the latest study objectively demonstrates this link between chronotype, emotional eating tendencies, and propensity for obesity. This latest work, carried out together with Harvard University and researcher Bárbara Vizmanos, from the University of Guadalajara (Mexico), has analyzed data from almost 4,000 people from Spain, Mexico and the United States. “In all people with an evening chronotype with obesity, the same circumstances are replicated: tendency to eat emotionally and tendency to lack control with food, cravings for specific foods and also the feeling of guilt after those cravings,” explains Marta Garaulet. However, the most important contribution of this research, which has recently been published by the journal 'Obesity', from the scientific society 'Obesity Society', is that for the first time it has been analyzed objectively, and not only through surveys, the status of an evening person and the relationship this has with eating habits. Specifically, a study of 162 people was carried out at the Virgen de La Arrixaca Hospital with a test called DLMO; which is a test that measures the evolution of melatonin, the sleep hormone, in dark conditions for five hours to be able to objectively determine when melatonin begins to rise at night in our body, and its evolution in the person. In this way we know when the biological night begins and we can objectively establish whether we are dealing with an evening or morning person. The increase in melatonin, the sleep hormone, begins for each person at a certain time and knowing it is important because it has been shown that dining late and eating food when there is already the presence of melatonin in the body has an impact on the tendency towards obesity. In this study, those who expressed a later onset of the biological night in their analyzes also turned out to be those who maintained clearer 'emotional eating' habits. Given this evidence, the question is how these people with an evening chronotype and emotional eating habits with a tendency to gain weight can address the problem. Marta Garaulet maintains that “in these cases the treatment cannot be a restrictive diet to reduce caloric intake, because this creates more lack of control and the approach must be from a behavioral point of view, since these people tend to eat in connection with their emotions, rather than hunger, and this must be taken into account in clinical practice, especially because the feeling of guilt in these people can be very great and the feeling that they cannot find a solution is widespread."" In order to help balance this trend, the researcher from the University of Murcia also recommends incorporating habits such as not doing intense exercise in the last hours of the day and trying to incorporate sport in the first hours of the day; since late sport causes the biological night to be delayed. In the same way, it is not advisable to use cell phones or screens an hour before going to sleep and it is beneficial to adjust meal times to the biological clock. In short, Garaulet explains, “it is about trying to change habits to get those people with an evening chronotype to move towards a more intermediate chronotype, so that this tendency to emotional eating is moderated.” And, especially, the researcher insists, avoid restrictive diets, which promote the problem and generate greater feelings of guilt.",2,32

"distinguished research professor from the UMU leads Viva in Vitro, the first IMIB Spin off","Viva in vitro (vivaivd.com), the biotechnology company led by Pablo Pelegrín, researcher and professor at the University of Murcia and deputy scientific director of the IMIB, has today inaugurated its headquarters and laboratories in the Murcia Science Park, belonging to the Development Institute (INFO), located on the Espinardo Campus. This is the first 'spin off' born from IMIB, the biomedical research institute of which the UMU is a part, and its inauguration was attended by the rector of the University of Murcia, José Luján and the director of INFO, Joaquín Gómez, who They have accompanied the members of Viva in vitro, among whom were its CEO, Joaquín Gómez Moya and the doctor Pablo Pelegrín; as well as Dr. Pablo Ramírez, scientific director of the IMIB and the director of the Foundation for Health Training and Research (FFIS), Fuensanta Martínez. The event also included the intervention of Mr. Jesús Cañavate, general director of Planning, Research, Pharmacy and Citizen Services of the Ministry of Health of the Government of the Region of Murcia. Pablo Pelegrín, who was hired through the Beatriz Galindo program, to attract research talent financed by the Ministry of Universities, and currently deputy scientific director of the IMIB; the biomedical research institute of which the University of Murcia is a part. During the inauguration, Viva's managers and technical team explained the specific advances in microfluidics and in the detection of very specific forms of the NLRP3 biomarker. It is a molecular complex that intervenes in the mechanisms of action related to various inflammatory reactions and disease processes, which can be serious and arouses great interest in the pharmaceutical industry and the venture capital community specialized in biotechnology and health. Next, they showed examples with demonstrations in the laboratory area of the new Viva in vitro headquarters. “The development of functional biomarkers based on NLRP3 macromolecular complexes represents a great advance for the diagnosis and prognosis of different diseases. For sepsis it allows us to make a personalized prognosis that was previously impossible and initiate early treatments aimed at modulating the response of the immune system. This has been possible thanks to the fact that we have been researching the molecular mechanisms of inflammation for more than 10 years and studying how these are modulated in different diseases,” said Pablo Pelegrín. The purpose of the startup is twofold: on the one hand, it consists of reducing death due to sepsis, providing a precise diagnosis of the patient's evolution, capable of reducing mortality in hospitals due to this type of exacerbated inflammatory reaction. And on the other hand, its purpose lies in being able to anticipate and adopt the measures and treatment appropriate to the state of the patient's immune system. This is where the biomarker developed by Viva in vitro plays a fundamental role. “In the course of developing the device we have realized that we can go further. The pharmaceutical industry is interested in the simple, cheap and scalable technique that we are developing, since it would facilitate the development of new therapies in numerous indications. Of course, our team is already working on its legal protection, on the regulatory aspects and on the studies that guide the best access strategy to a market as complex as the healthcare market,” highlighted the CEO of Viva in vitro, Joaquín Gómez Moya. . In the words of the director of INFO, Joaquín Gómez, “Viva in vitro is a clear example of the potential that exists in the Region of Murcia in the biotechnology sector. I am convinced that in the future we will talk about it as a success story at an international level, thanks to having been able to transfer a solution to a global problem to the market.” 1.2 million investment to prevent sepsis In the last year, Viva in vitro has carried out two capital increases, thanks to the support of highly qualified private investors, worth 1 million two hundred thousand euros, within a financial plan designed ex professed for that development and the necessary specialized equipment. According to its CEO, Joaquín Gómez Moya, “the company is considering a possible expansion with the help of specialist Spanish, European or Israeli venture capital funds, to incorporate talent into its management with extensive contacts and knowledge in corporate operations, to improve its governance and to gain negotiating strength against the large corporations that are contacting it.” The latest reports published by the World Health Organization (WHO) indicate that, due to sepsis or septicemia, 11 million people die every year, including many children. The WHO also assures that almost half of the 49 million cases of septicemia annually worldwide occur in children, with 2.9 million deaths that could be avoided, for the most part, through early diagnosis and clinical and clinical care. proper care. About Viva in Vitro Viva in Vitro arises after the detection of a need presented by certain patients who suffer from complex symptoms of abdominal sepsis, with long hospital stays and who frequently end up dying. Sepsis or septicemia occurs when the patient's response to an infection results in organ or multiple organ failure, with the possibility of death from this cause. With the project to manufacture the first prototype that will allow the application of a new biomarker system to patients, the purpose of Viva in Vitro is to reduce death due to sepsis, stratifying patients early, in order to identify those that may develop complications, being able to offer new treatments and reducing hospital stays and mortality due to sepsis.",16,78

The UMU 2030 Agenda Sustainable Development Chair trains more than 40 public employees in SDGs,"This June, the Chair of Sustainable Development and Agenda 2030 at the University of Murcia (UMU) trained more than 40 public employees for 30 hours, divided into three sessions, taught by representatives of the La Mundial collective and professors from the Faculty of Economy and Business. The first day was led by Ignacio Martínez (La Mundial), professor of Political Science at the Complutense University of Madrid, who offered an introduction to the 2030 Agenda, its background, the main problems of the triple economic, social and environmental dimension of sustainability. , and the Agenda as a political agreement. On the second day, the speaker Raffaela Galante, specialist in international cooperation and member of La Mundial, focused on the coherence of public policies, the role of local administrations and the need for multilevel policies to be interrelated, “something that it makes the operations of the public administration difficult,” he pointed out. The third session was directed by the researchers of the Mª Carmen Alarcón Chair, Eugenio Sánchez, and the co-directors of this Chair, Inés López and Federico Martínez-Carrasco. They mainly addressed the action plan, research and diagnosis of the Region of Murcia in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda since 2019, with special emphasis on education for global citizenship. For Inés López, “the Autonomous Community is in a good position in terms of sustainable development. Therefore, in these sessions we have shared these advances, in addition to materials of interest and work methodologies, which are based on aligning general budgets to advance the fulfillment of the 17 SDGs.” This course was attended by workers from up to seven ministries: Water, Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries; Transparency, Participation and Cooperation; Development and Infrastructure; Environment, Mar Menor, Universities and Research; Education, Vocational Training and Employment; Economy, Treasury, European Funds and Digital Administration; Presidency, Tourism, Culture, Youth, Sports and Spokesperson. Research and dissemination of Agenda 2030 Founded last September 2022, the objective of this new UMU Chair is to establish a space dedicated to research, training and dissemination regarding the achievement of the 17 SDGs established by the United Nations in the 2030 Agenda. Its objective is projected on three main areas around the idea of sustainable development, from its triple perspective: economic, social and environmental. The Chair serves as a link between the academy, public institutions and private actors committed to these objectives to advance their achievement, through carrying out diagnoses and formulating proposals, dissemination and social dissemination, and training employees. public.

The CEMOP presents its study on the effects that the 28M electoral campaign had on voters,"The CEMOP, a research group at the University of Murcia, presented this Wednesday the results of its post-election survey, a study that analyzes the effects that the electoral campaign had on the behavior of citizens when casting their vote. The presentation of the conclusions was carried out by Ismael Crespo Martínez and Juan José García Escribano, as well as by the professors of Political Science and Sociology respectively, Inmaculada Melero López and Belén García Palma. The main conclusions of this study are the following: Television continues to be the most used medium to follow the campaign. According to the conclusions of the study, the majority of citizens of the Region, more than 68%, used television to be aware of the bell. The most used television channel was 7TV (31.1%), followed by La 1 (13.9%) and Antena 3 (13.4%). In this way, regional television is consolidated as an information reference when local issues are discussed. Regarding the written press, the majority of citizens also opted for regional newspapers to follow the campaign. 15.5% were informed through La Verdad compared to 6.8% who did so through La Opinión. It is notable, however, that 67.4% of those interviewed did not resort to the written press to obtain information about the campaign. A similar level of use to that of the radio. Regarding this medium, it is not a fully regional station that is preferred, but rather La Cope (9.8%) and La Ser (9.6%) share the leadership. Who do we follow on social networks to inform ourselves about the elections? Although the presence of social networks raises doubts about the mediated communication model, that is, the possibility of obtaining information by going directly to the issuers without going through the media, the truth is that the majority of interviewees who used the networks to stay informed of the campaign they did so by following media profiles (22.4%). The informational reference in networks is the media. Only 15.5% stated that they followed profiles of parties or candidates and a scant 3.2% opted for influencers to stay up to date with the campaign. Young people between 18 and 29 years old are the ones who follow party or candidate profiles the most, ten points more than the population average. The most debated topic of the campaign According to those interviewed, the topic most debated by the parties according to what they saw in the media was water and the Transfer (14.2%), followed by the Mar Menor (12.7%). . The controversy with the EH Bildu candidacies (6.3%) is quite far away. Although different analysts agree in pointing out an atmosphere of nationalization of the 28M campaign, the two topics that the interviewees perceive as most discussed are fully regional in nature. The only thing that stands out is the appearance of a national issue, the one referring to the controversy with the EH Bildu lists, which marked the beginning of the campaign. The debate did not capture the attention of citizens, 84% did not follow it, but it notably helped UP voters to strengthen their vote. Although it was the only opportunity to see the main candidates contrast their ideas, 84% 2% of the citizens of the Region did not follow the debate organized by the College of Journalists and broadcast on 7TV. The voters of the PP and Unidas Podemos in 2019 were the ones who paid the most attention to this appointment. Among those who did watch the debate, 63.3% stated that it did not influence them at all when voting, while 28.4% stated that what they saw that night reinforced their decision to vote. In short, the debate did not move citizens' electoral preferences and aroused little interest. Despite the controversial performance of the Podemos candidate, a high 83.3% of this party's supporters affirm that the meeting reinforced what they had already planned to vote for. María Marín's decision did not take its toll on her in electoral terms and, what's more, not only did it not raise doubts among her voters, but it also served to reaffirm their preferences. In fact, UP supporters constitute the group of voters for whom the debate most helped strengthen their vote. The campaign as a topic of conversation: when politics sneaks into the coffee 24.5% of those interviewed affirm that they talked about the elections regularly with their family, friends or co-workers, while 30.8% said so. did from time to time. Abstentionists were the ones who talked the least about the elections in their circles of trust, while 69.7% of young people between 18 and 29 years old made this topic a reason for regular conversation. This is especially relevant data and contrasts with the story of young people as a poorly politicized or disaffected group. But did these conversations take place in a climate of confrontation? 48.1% of those interviewed stated that when talking about the elections in their environment, the opinions were not the same, but the debate was calm. However, 10.2% recognized that the opinions were not the same, and that some type of confrontation was also generated. Those who encountered the most confrontation when discussing this issue were Podemos voters. Polls do not influence the voter Faced with the supposed “pollocracy”, that is, how polls rather than reflecting opinion want to influence it, the data is clear. There is no such trend. 19.3% of those interviewed responded that they had been aware of the surveys carried out by the CEMOP, a reference in the Region in public opinion polls. Among those who were aware of the surveys, 70.8% declared that these studies did not influence them at all and 21.5% stated that they served to reinforce their decision. Abstention was concentrated on the left and the center, compared to a mobilized right. The CEMOP study identifies that abstention occurred more significantly among people who identify ideologically as left or center. In particular, a demobilization process is observed around the PSOE and Ciudadanos voters. Among those who decided not to vote, up to 6.7% would have voted for the PSOE. Abstention has harmed the electoral results of the left-wing parties and, especially, of the PSOE, although once the results are known, the abstentionist electorate is divided almost equally between those who would now vote to reinforce the winner (PP vote) and those who would remain. They regret having stayed home and knowing what happened they would vote for the PSOE. The majority of citizens decided their vote before the campaign and the voters with the most doubts were those on the left. 71.9% of citizens had decided their vote before the start of the official fifteen days of the campaign. 7.2% of citizens made the decision on election day and less than a sixth of the total (15.5%) did so during the campaign. The left-wing electorate is the one that had the least decided on its vote before the start of the campaign. In fact, an important part of left-wing voters decided their vote in the last days of the campaign or even on election day itself. The emotions aroused by leaders: do politicians excite us? Only in the case of Fernando López Miras is there a majority of the people interviewed who express that the candidate has transmitted some emotion to them. The main emotion aroused by Fernando López Miras' speeches was tranquility. In general, the right produces greater feelings of tranquility, while the left produces greater feelings of anger among the electorate of the Region of Murcia. María Marín is the leader who produces the greatest processes of polarization. It provokes strong support among its voters and strong rejection among voters on the right. 20% of PP, Ciudadanos and VOX voters felt fear or anger at the Podemos leader's speeches, but, at the same time, she is the leader who arouses the most pride and enthusiasm among her voters (40% compared to 32, 2% of Antelo, 29.2% of López Miras or the scarce 20.5% of Vélez). The effects of the campaign: did it serve any purpose? Thanks to the panel design of the CEMOP study, it is possible to analyze the changes that occurred between voting intentions prior to the elections and what was actually voted. The main effect of the electoral campaign in the Region of Murcia has been reinforcement, since the majority of voters have kept their behavior stable between their initial wishes and their final vote. Secondly, an important activation effect stands out, mainly around the PP, higher than that of the 2019 campaign, followed by the deactivation effect and the smallest effect being that of conversion, which was the second largest effect in the 2019 campaign. Clearly the 2019 and 2023 campaigns were different in terms of their effects: in 2019 the change prevailed and the main effect after the reinforcement was conversion, while in 2023 activation has been imposed. The campaign with the best positive performance was that of the PP. The rest of the candidates saw their expectations reduced during the campaign, especially the PSOE, which dropped 2.6 points, but also VOX (-1.6). Furthermore, the PP convinced the majority of those who were undecided: 22.8% of those who had doubts about who to vote for at the beginning of the campaign ended up doing so for the PP, compared to 13.8% who preferred not to go to the polls. .",16,98

UMU researcher Enrique Ortega Forte receives the second prize for dissemination on Medicine and Health Lilly Foundation - The Conversation,"Enrique Ortega Forte, predoctoral researcher in the Metalofharmaceuticals group at the University of Murcia (UMU), has just received the second prize for dissemination on Medicine and Health awarded by the Lilly Foundation and The Conversation for his article Making the invisible visible: light and the intimate life of cells. Among 90 candidates presented in this third edition of the contest, Ortega Forte has been selected by a jury that has valued ""the excellent pool of young people who, in addition to researching in their different fields, have the sensitivity and ability to disseminate the science they develop."" to the rest of society."" The award-winning article recounts the discovery of bioluminescence in the sea and how this fluorescence, naturally present in biology, has been used to develop scientific studies that try to combat cancer or Parkinson's. “I have always found it very important to disseminate what we do in the laboratory and this opportunity seemed perfect to tell part of our work,” highlights the UMU researcher. “One of the things we use most in the laboratory is something as simple as light. If we want to observe what happens inside cells we use fluorescent labeling methods. Fluorescence is also a phenomenon of light, but with it we can make parts of the cells “glow” that we could not see before. For me fluorescence has something special. I find it somewhat fascinating. And it is used routinely in all laboratories in the world,” concludes Ortega Forte. It is the second consecutive year that the University of Murcia receives this recognition for youth outreach. In 2022, Claudia García Cobarro, researcher and doctoral student in the Physiology, Nutrition and Chronobiology group at the UMU, also won this award for her informative article Luz, architect of life. On that occasion, García Cobarro competed alongside 86 other candidates, among which the jury highlighted ""the level of the works, their narrative structure and the use of ingenious literary resources.""

They develop a tool to optimize the joint production of wind and solar energy,"Renewable energies, particularly wind and solar, are called to play a fundamental role in the transition towards decarbonized energy systems to stop climate change. However, its integration into development plans is compromised due to the intermittency of its production, subject to the variability of atmospheric conditions. To face this challenge, an international study led by researchers from the University of Murcia and the Interdisciplinary Thematic Platform (PTI) Climate and Climate Services of the CSIC proposes a strategy, based on the analysis of the natural variability of resources, to plan a deployment of wind and solar photovoltaic installations that optimizes their spatio-temporal complementarity and minimizes fluctuations in the joint production of both energies. The result of the research has been put into practice with the creation of a free access tool called Climax. It is a model that identifies regions with similar temporal variability of both resources (solar and wind) and determines the optimal shares of each technology in these regions. That is, look for those places where solar and wind energy can be used to the maximum from a perspective that is not individual, but joint. According to the researchers, an optimal location of the installations of each technology would reduce the monthly anomalies of the total production of wind and solar electricity by up to 60%. Despite the experimental and pilot nature of the application, the mere development of this tool represents a substantial advance compared to previous works that provided strictly academic research on the complementarity of both energies. “We present a new methodology based on climate science to reduce the unwanted intermittency of joint solar and wind generation, with the aim of helping to plan the deployment of new renewable production units,” the researchers explain in the study published in Earth's Future magazine. In this sense, the researchers consider that the European regions included in the analysis should make efforts in their energy policies towards the deployment of more solar installations in order to reduce the month-to-month volatility of combined wind-solar production. “The benefits would be enormous, especially for regions in southern Europe and at the continental level,” they conclude.

The University of Murcia renews its visual identity with a design that links tradition with the search for innovation to 'Put heart in knowledge',"The University of Murcia renews its visual identity with the creation of an innovative brand architecture consistent with current needs, but that maintains the connection with the origins of an institution that has its roots in medieval Murcia. At the center of this change is the transformation of the institutional logo, with the redesign of the shield of Alfonso From now on, a special role as a more relaxed logo symbol. 'Putting heart into knowledge' is the motto that will accompany this new logo, which aims to complement the institutional one by providing closeness and connection to younger audiences. The rector, José Luján, and the vice-rector for Transfer, Communication and Scientific Dissemination, José Manuel López Nicolás, presented this Monday the project to change the image of the institution in an event held at the Regional Film Archive of Murcia. The new design, which was approved last Friday by the Governing Council of the University of Murcia, has been developed by the Rubio & del Amo studio, headed by Guillermo Rubio and Julián Garnés, both former students of the University of Murcia. Murcia and recently named 'inspiring alumni' by the Faculty of Communication and Documentation. Rector Luján wanted to insist on the importance that the union of tradition and a look towards the future has for the University of Murcia ""and this is something that the visual presence that we present today contemplates perfectly, because the University of Murcia is the driving force of change that wants to be at the forefront of culture, science and technology, but always keeping in mind the roots of its centuries-old tradition.” López Nicolás, for his part, added that it was decided to address this change “because the University of Murcia needs a coherent brand architecture with a design designed for the current digital context that makes it recognizable and close to all its audiences, especially to the students.” These are two of the most important points in this renovation, which will not only affect the institutional logo, but the changes in the institutional image will permeate the entire visual image of the University. Faculties and services will adapt their logos so that, in a harmonious way, through typography, strokes and color, they are visually linked to the matrix image, thus building the cohesive brand structure without losing the uniqueness that should characterize these institutions included within the UMU. The design chosen for this new image is flexible and adaptive, well thought out for the digital context. The design of the current University shield was conceived at a time when the priority was printed media and presented difficulties in adapting to spaces such as social networks. The synthesis of lines of the new shield solves this problem and adds to the image an imprint of modernity and innovation that links with the mission of the University of Murcia. The new institutional fonts also contribute to this visual message, combining robustness, tradition and modernity in their lines. In this way, the aim is to capture the essence of a generalist university like the University of Murcia, in which studies in the humanities, social sciences, arts, science and technology coexist. The institutional colors also change, which from now on will be solemn blue, vibrant red and light gray. Rubio and del Amo have presented all the technical details of this new visual identity; whose objective has been, from the first steps of the project, to maintain the solemnity that a century-old institution needs and, at the same time, establish closeness with all its audiences to strengthen the feeling of belonging. Regarding the other great challenge, that of creating a recognizable brand system, they have opted to transcend the idea of a logocentric brand in favor of a visual system where typography, new colors and shape design are the keys to this visual recognition. Development of the brand universe With the presentation of the new logos, central elements of the visual identity, the development of the entire brand universe begins from now on, which will involve the redesign of logos of faculties and those services with more social presence ; as well as the implementation of the new image to all spaces of the University (website, social networks, signage, stationery...). The change will be progressive and in phases consistent with the magnitude of the change, which will be addressed in the coming months. Work on developing all of the new brand's apps will begin this summer. The culmination of this renovation, López Nicolás added, “will place us in terms of visual image at the level of reference universities, both nationally and internationally”, something especially important “in a context in which the internationalization of teaching Higher education and research are essential.” The rector concluded the event by emphasizing that the motto chosen for this new image could not be more accurate ""because if there is something that we are very clear about at the University of Murcia, it is that we put our heart into knowledge and everything we do.""

The UMU develops software capable of automatically differentiating between healthy and pathological corneas,"Artificial intelligence is capable of detecting even corneas with very mild edema, not detectable with current clinical instrumentation and in stages in which the anomaly would not have yet affected the patient's vision. The cornea is the transparent structure located in the anterior part. of the eyeball. Edema can occur in it, a pathology that occurs when water is retained inside, causing the different layers that form it to become translucent and causing vision problems. But just as artificial intelligence is capable of writing texts or constructing images that seem real to the naked eye, the UMU Optics Laboratory research group has developed software capable of automatically differentiating between healthy and edematous corneas. A publication in the IEEE Journal of Selected Topics collects these results. Artificial intelligence also needs to learn, just like humans. In the field of Biophotonics, deep learning techniques - which aim at automatic analysis without human intervention - require a minimum of 1,000 images for each class or training. This imposition in a clinical environment and depending on certain pathologies is often difficult to achieve. A collaboration between Juan Manuel Bueno, professor of Optics at the UMU, and Stefan Stanciu, senior scientist at the Center for Microscopy and Information Processing at the Polytechnic University of Bucharest, has managed to solve this problem by creating a new algorithm called FLIMBA (Flexible Light -weight Model for Bioimage Analysis). Algorithms beyond social networks The model has managed to reduce the number of images needed to 100, which not only significantly reduces learning time, but also opens the doors to using it in clinical environments where the number of images available is limited. The researchers' results show that the algorithm, without user intervention, is capable of detecting even corneas with very mild edema, not detectable with current clinical instrumentation and at stages in which the anomaly would not have yet significantly affected the patient's vision. The results obtained, although in this first phase they are under ex-vivo conditions, that is, the corneal tissue has been extracted to be able to investigate it, represent an objective and precise analysis procedure that can serve as a reliable diagnostic tool in the field of Ophthalmology and Biomedicine. The interest of the researchers from both groups goes further because in a second stage that has already begun they will incorporate learning with other types of corneal pathology, such as keratoconus, a condition that occurs when the cornea becomes thinner and develops a corneal shape.

The UMU creates a worldwide reference methodology to transform scientific research into innovations for society,"Two professors from the University of Murcia publish 'Lean Startup for scientists', a book that adapts a methodology used in emerging companies around the world to scientific production, showing that science is synonymous with development and innovation. The edition of this book has been promoted by the Office of Transfer of Research Results (OTRI) of the University of Murcia, thanks to the financing of the “+Spin-Off Program” developed by the OTRI itself and financed by the Department of Business , Social Economy and Self-Employed. Countless Spanish scientific publications do not come out of the paper, in 2019 less than 6% of the research of national universities was financed by companies and only 10% of the Spanish industry sought to collaborate with higher education institutions to innovate their production. Not to mention the application of patents and creation of spin-offs, an activity that should be taking off, and is instead decreasing in recent years in Spanish universities. After reflecting on these figures and searching for a solution, the work Lean Startup was born for scientists in the Department of Marketing and Market Research of the University of Murcia (UMU), its authors José Javier Ruiz Cartagena and Carmen Mora professors, entrepreneurs and experts in agile methodologies with the collaboration of the Vice-Rector's Office for Transfer, Communication and Scientific Dissemination, through the OTRI and different research groups at the University of Murcia. These data show that the transfer of knowledge and collaboration between Spanish universities and companies is deficient. It is common that Spanish scientific discoveries do not leave the paper and remain out of the reach of society without applying their findings to enrich the national market. This is not due to a lack of interest on the part of researchers, on the contrary, the search for leaving the laboratory and showing their achievements to society is increasing, but bureaucratic barriers, the lack of political initiatives for science and The little monetization to finance projects prevents them from making their ideas a reality. University means wealth and innovation Lean Startup for scientists adapts the Lean Startup methodology, a global reference for business creation, an innovative way of managing processes, eliminating those activities that do not add value and further improving the quality of the final product. As stated by professors José Javier Ruiz Cartagena and Carmen Mora ""Throughout these collaborations we realized that sometimes these research groups were dedicating a lot of effort, energy and money to lines of research that ended up dying in scientific publications and that were not “They managed to have a real impact.” From there the idea was born. Through this project they seek balance, how to make rigorous research useful for the advancement of society. The intention of this work is to help the new generation of outsider scientists who want to leave the laboratory to boost their hours of research in the Lean Startup methodology. In addition, the creators of the book also launched the website Think outside the lab, a portal that allows scientists, academics, or research centers to access the main tools of this technology for free. methodology and make your findings fly to the top.",9,123
UMU study uses the autofluorescence of microalgae to study their adaptation to environmental conditions,"In addition to bacteria or mites, there are also microscopic algae. The Algology Laboratory and the Microscopy and Image Analysis Service of the University of Murcia (UMU) have developed a new protocol for physiological studies in microalgae, that is, to study their function as living beings. They have taken the red alga Chroothece mobilis as a model organism, a species that can colonize from habitats with poor lighting, such as caves, or develop in full sun. They can also live in inland waters or grow in the depths of the ocean. The professor of Botany at the UMU Algology Laboratory Marina Aboal explains that in addition to chlorophyll, which is essential for photosynthesis, they have accessory pigments that can give them bluish, reddish or orange colors, the so-called phycobiliproteins and carotenoids. Color manifests itself according to the proportion of the corresponding pigment and its synthesis is a response to the environment in which they live. “Red algae, for example, tend to prefer places where little light reaches, such as the depths of the sea,” says the researcher. Microalgae use these pigments to respond to changes in the habitat and since they are autofluorescent, they can be used to understand the physiology of these organisms with the help of a confocal microscope. One species of microalgae to study them all This method developed at the UMU will allow physiological analyzes to be carried out at the cellular level of other species of microalgae and will help adjust the optimal growth conditions for their cultivation, which can be very useful in food biotechnology , cosmetics or pharmacy, or knowing the most unfavorable conditions for their development, which can be of great interest in the study of the biodeterioration of architectural monuments. “Monuments that are exposed to natural or artificial light, such as tourist caves, can harbor communities of microalgae that cause the so-called stone disease. The growth of these organisms can cover artistic samples such as cave paintings, for example,” explains Aboal. This work has been carried out in collaboration with the Microscopy and Image Analysis Service and the Plant Biotechnology Service of the Scientific and Technical Research Area (ACTI) of the University of Murcia and the Sant Joan de Déu Hospital of Barcelona. The protocol has been published in the JoVE Journal, where scientific articles are published in video format.",14,78

"José Manuel López Nicolás, appointed member of the Group of Experts that coordinates the Transfer Plan of the Ministry of Science and Innovation","José Manuel López Nicolás, vice-rector for Transfer, Communication and Scientific Dissemination of the University of Murcia, has been appointed member of the Group of Experts that coordinates the Transfer and Collaboration Plan published by the Ministry of Science and Innovation through its General Secretariat of Innovation. In an event held at the CSIC headquarters in Madrid, López Nicolás presented to the Minister of Universities, the Minister of Science and Innovation and different people belonging to the scientific and business world, the innovative Knowledge Transfer model that he has implemented successful at the University of Murcia from the Vice-Rector's Office that he directs and which was already recognized by the Conference of Rectors of Spanish Universities (CRUE). In the last four years, the UMU has multiplied by seven the number of knowledge transfer projects achieved and last 2022 this institution broke both the record for contracts with companies and the income obtained thanks to business collaboration. The Plan is structured around 3 lines of action and includes 15 measures. The first axis focuses on the transfer of knowledge generated in the public research system to companies, the public sector and society, through different channels such as the creation of new companies, patent licenses, the dissemination of publications or scientific advice. The second axis includes measures to promote the collaboration of companies with universities, other higher education centers and public research centers during the knowledge generation phase, not only through specific collaboration projects for innovation, but also through new, more ambitious models of public-private alliances, as well as through the mobility of research personnel and citizen science. The third axis of the Plan aims to improve the training of research, technical and management personnel in relation to the valorization of knowledge, as well as enhance ecosystem connections, paying special attention to the role of technology centers, knowledge transfer offices, and other intermediate agents and platforms that help the interaction of the actors of the innovation system. This third axis of the Plan is transversal, since it affects both the transfer of knowledge (axis 1) and public-private collaboration for innovation (axis 2). The group of experts of which López Nicolás is a part will contribute to the evaluation of the different measures contained in the Plan, to their coordination and to verify the success of the 3 axes of action. On the other hand, López Nicolás has also been appointed member of the Advisory Council of the Spanish Foundation for Science and Technology (FECYT) for his work in scientific dissemination at both an individual and institutional level.

In both positions, López Nicolás is part of the group of independent members belonging to various scientific or business institutions.",9,154
The cycle of conferences 'The UMU and Scientific Culture' closes with an artistic look at nature,"'Art and landscape: exploring the relationship between human creativity and our environment' is the title of the talk that will be given on June 20 at 7:00 p.m. in the Ámbito Cultural Room of El Corte Inglés by the Dean of the Faculty of Fine Arts from the University of Murcia (UMU) and artist, Victoria Chezner. “Art and landscape have a very close and complex relationship,” says Chezner. Human creativity has always been influenced by the natural world and everything around us. The conference invites you to look to the past and observe how artists have represented the landscape throughout history. But currently the concept of landscape has changed and grown beyond how we perceive and experience it. Contemporary artists have reconstructed this concept, creating works that provide new discourses that link both social and natural sciences. Additionally, during the talk the artist will also give a brief tour of her artistic work. Victoria Chezner Artist, dean and professor of the Faculty of Fine Arts of the UMU, she has a doctorate in arts and her main lines of research are the ethical and aesthetic foundations of the landscape, both in the field of scientific and artistic production. Over the years he has participated in more than 60 national and international exhibitions, 40 of which are collective and more than 20 individual.

"Open letter from CRUE to the Ministry of Inclusion, Social Security and Migration","José Luis Escrivá Belmonte Minister Ministry of Inclusion, Social Security and Migration In Madrid, June 15, 2023 Dear Minister: From the Universities, the undersigned want to express our utmost concern about the entry into force of the mandatory contribution to the Social Security of all students who are carrying out external academic internships from the date of October 1, 2023, in accordance with the fifty-second provision of Royal Decree-Law 2/2023, of March 16, of urgent measures to expand the rights of pensioners, reduce the gender gap and establish a new sustainability framework for the public pension system, validated by the Congress of Deputies. We would like to highlight the following points: Although RD-Law 2/2023 establishes that the obligation to contribute falls on the company or institution receiving the students, universities are being forced to assume the contribution of “unpaid” internships. ”, in order to guarantee that university students can graduate. This situation arises due to two fundamental factors: 1. Public entities, where 60% of the internships are carried out, are requesting the signing of addendums that include a clause specifying that the university is responsible for the management and the corresponding expense. 2. We fear that private companies will join this request, since they collaborate with the university by providing internship opportunities to our students, but they are not willing to assume the costs or the associated administrative burden. This new obligation represents a great problem for universities, since we must manage a high number of internships to guarantee the training of students. To do this, we require the following resources: 1. Development of a computer platform to be able to carry out the data loading necessary for the quotation process in bulk and to limit the bureaucratic burden. 2. Implement a simplified registration and withdrawal methodology based on the practice standards of the official study plans that all students must pass as credits of the official degree. 3. Provide the necessary human resources to manage registrations, cancellations and control of practice days. 4. Allocation of an economic budget for the next academic years. Funds not available in 2023. On the other hand, we are concerned that, since the publication of this Royal Decree-Law, we have not received any communication or clear instructions from your Ministry in relation to the procedure to follow. We have tried to obtain guidance through the provincial delegations of the Social Security Treasury, but unfortunately, despite their good will, they have not been able to provide us with concrete answers to our questions. For all this, given the uncertainty in which we are immersed and the necessary adjustments in our management systems and although the desirable thing would be to repeal the norm, at least we urgently request that the necessary legal instruments be arbitrated to delay one year the entry into force of said measure. Furthermore, in this period, the appropriate measures should also be adopted to guarantee that the bonus reaches 100% of the quota permanently or, where appropriate, this cost is assumed by the entities. We thank you in advance for your attention to this situation and trust in your understanding. We remain at your disposal to provide any necessary information.

The University of Murcia addresses the impact of ChatGPT and Artificial Intelligence in higher education from all perspectives,"The University of Murcia (UMU) held a conference this Wednesday dedicated to exploring the uses of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and GPT Chat in university education. This conference, promoted by the UMU Vice-Rector for Strategy and Digital University, included the participation of prominent experts and representatives of different profiles of the university community. The event has highlighted the importance of these technologies in the academic field and their potential to drive the personalization of learning. The rector of the University of Murcia, José Luján, opened the day and highlighted the crucial role of AI and GPT Chat in the transformation of education. Luján has pointed out that ""the University must respond to the challenge posed by the emergence of artificial intelligence, which affects daily activities, to provide solutions to society in a time of transformation like the current one."" Along these lines, Luján has remarked, this day of reflection and sharing of challenges in the face of the totally new paradigm is proposed.” For his part, Pedro Miguel Ruiz, vice-rector of Strategy and Digital University, has highlighted that the GPT Chat is “the tip of the iceberg” of the use of artificial intelligence because its applications have to do with “the generation of content that we have always attributed to humans, like text or image.” The emergence of this tool, the vice-rector has stated, directly affects the University in the administrative, management and, especially, educational fields and has assured that the role of the University must be to “take advantage of all technological advances to improve the experience.” that we give to our students and the rest of the users”, taking into account that these are very accessible technologies, that demonstrate quality in the results and that they are free, so their generalization seems unstoppable. How artificial intelligence will affect the teaching and learning processes has been one of the central points in the morning debate tables and conferences. Formative evaluation, which involves accompanying the student in the process, rather than evaluating a final result, is one of the ideas raised. The idea that the University must take advantage of all the potential that artificial intelligence offers in its training processes is one of the objectives raised in this day of reflection. The first conference was given by Fabrizio Magnani, Senior Executive Partner at Gartner, who presented a presentation on the various uses of ChatGPT and generative AI in universities, emphasizing how these tools can enrich the educational experience. A subsequent roundtable addressed the challenges and opportunities from different perspectives. Emilio Martínez Navarro, responsible for developing the UMU ethical code, from the Faculty of Philosophy, highlighted the importance of ethical and responsible use of AI in education. For her part, María del Mar Sánchez, professor in the Department of Didactics and School Organization of the Faculty of Education, highlighted how AI can be used to personalize learning and adapt it to the individual needs of students. Raquel Sevilla Paños, Student Delegate of the Faculty of Chemistry, provided a student vision, expressing her enthusiasm for the integration of AI and GPT Chat in teaching. Mercedes Valdés, secretary of the Faculty of Informatics, provided a technical perspective, pointing out the potential of these technologies to improve the efficiency and quality of education. Manuel Fernández Salmerón, Data Protection delegate at the University of Murcia, shared his regulatory vision and highlighted the importance of guaranteeing data privacy and security in the context of AI. The second round table, moderated by Pedro Miguel Ruiz, Vice Chancellor of Strategy and Digital University, focused on addressing the specific issue of how the UMU could implement these technologies. Francisco G. Díaz Baños, dean of the Faculty of Chemistry, and Antonio Flores, dean of the Faculty of Informatics, shared their perspectives from their respective disciplines. María Juárez Muñoz, president of the Student Council of the University of Murcia, and Sonia Madrid Cánovas, Vice-rector of Studies, also offered their points of view. The day concluded with the closing by Alfonsa García Ayala, Vice-Rector for Coordination and Quality, who highlighted the importance of continuing to explore and take advantage of the potential of AI and GPT Chat in the context of the UMU. With this event, the University of Murcia places itself at the forefront of education, promoting the adoption of innovative technologies that enrich the learning experience and encourage its personalization. The responsible integration of Artificial Intelligence and GPT Chat in higher education shows UMU's commitment to providing its students with quality training, adapted to the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.",4,30

Every summer for almost 30 years, records continue to be broken, increasing up to five times the forest burned areas in the center and north of the state compared to previous records that extend until 1971. The article has had the participation of other experts from the University of California, the University of Cantabria and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The study, published in the journal PNAS, correlates the increase in the area burned in California forests with an increase in temperature due to climate change caused by human activity. Through numerical simulations, the anthropogenic scenario has been reproduced, that is, the one that contains greenhouse emissions, aerosols or atmospheric pollutants; and the natural one, which only takes into account variations in solar radiation, volcanic eruptions or ocean patterns without the pollution generated by humans. Comparison of climate models Model simulations that take into account human activity show 172% more burned area than if only the natural scenario were taken into account. “The impact of anthropogenic climate change has largely contributed to an increase in the number of burned areas. During the years 1996 to 2021, around 1,710 km² were burned per year, while in the period from 1971 to 1995, an average of 361 km² were burned,” clarifies researcher Marco Turco. In most forest fires, what determines the ease of initiation and the area burned are the flammable materials present in the natural environment, their distribution in the environment and their moisture content. If the fuel is dry, it is more likely to burn and spread the fire more quickly. As temperatures rise due to global warming, fires tend to be larger because vegetation contains less moisture, is drier and more flammable. Risk of fire in the future “In the coming decades, an annual increase in burned forests of up to 52% is expected in the period from 2031 to 2050,” predicts Marco Turco. The continued rise of this phenomenon has had a dramatic impact on both human activities and ecosystems. California's ten largest wildfires have occurred in the last 20 years. Forests have been reduced to ashes and soot, but in addition to environmental damage, this has also led to health problems and devastating socioeconomic consequences. The authors suggest that policymakers and communities can mitigate the impacts of climate change on wildfires by implementing measures such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving forest management practices , investing in early warning systems and firefighting resources, and promoting public awareness campaigns. ""We hope that our findings inspire collaboration among stakeholders to develop effective solutions to this problem,"" reflects the researcher.

UMU-Company Project develops a natural alternative against the main protozoan disease that affects pigs,"The University of Murcia has developed, together with the Murcian company Agropor and the Madrid-based Grupo Omega de Nutrición Animal, an applied research project whose objective has been to identify a natural alternative that would eliminate the administration of pharmacological products to pigs for the prevention and /or treatment of neonatal coccidiosis and that, in addition, stimulates the animals' immunity and favors the balance of their intestinal microbiota. Neonatal coccidiosis, caused by Cystoisospora suis, is possibly the most important protozoan parasitic disease of swine. It causes diarrhea that affects 90% of piglets 5-9 days old, of which 50% suffer a relapse during the following week. In addition, Cystoisospora predisposes piglets to suffer from bacterial and viral infections that increase cases of disease, increase mortality and total expenses derived from management on farms. The delayed growth of piglets, the high number of infected animals (frequently more than 75%) and the costs of treating diarrhea cause great economic losses for the sector. “All of this is aggravated because the alteration it causes in productive rates – lower daily weight gain, higher rate of transformation of food into meat, etc. – causes the piglets that make up each litter not to reach the established weight to move on to the next. production stage or they do not do it at the same time, increasing the heterogeneity in the litters and making it necessary for them to remain for a longer time in the farrowing pen, which cannot be occupied by a new sow,"" says Professor Rocío Ruiz de Ybáñez responsible for this research by the UMU. To combat this parasite, piglets are systematically administered a dose of toltrazuril, a drug that is licensed to control the elimination of the parasite. But there are several problems associated with this practice, among which it is worth highlighting the demand by society for foods free of pharmacological residues, the development of resistance to this drug or the relatively long withdrawal period of the product, which limits its administration in piglets in farrowing pens that will go to slaughter after weaning (roasted suckling pig market). The scientific work carried out by the UMU researchers consisted of measuring, initially in vitro, the effectiveness of a wide range of plant extracts, using cell cultures from which the most suitable ones were selected for subsequent tests. in animals. The specific composition selected was a mixture of oregano and cashew extracts. Once the mixture was prepared at the appropriate doses and it was verified that all its characteristics remained unchanged after its incorporation into feed manufacturing, feeding tests on the mothers were carried out. The study was completed with the application of the liquid mixture of natural products only to the piglets, imitating the practice currently followed on farms. The results obtained after the studies have made it possible to verify that there is no problem of feed rejection by the pigs and no episode of diarrhea is observed in the animals treated with this experimental product. “It has been shown that the premix, included in sow feed or administered orally to piglets, reduces the excretion of the parasite in the animals' feces to values similar to those obtained after the administration of toltrazuril, but also improves their immune status without affecting to the productive parameters of mothers or piglets,” adds Professor Ruiz de Ybáñez. The company Grupo Omega de Nutrición Animal is currently finalizing the developments for its application on a commercial level. This project has been financed by the CDTI through the project “Natural alternatives in the control of Cystoisospora suis in pigs”",12,11

Research from the UMU determines that increased use of screens worsens computer vision syndrome in people with presbyopia,"Computer vision syndrome is a set of visual and ocular symptoms that occur after spending several hours in a row using electronic devices. The study from the University of Murcia (UMU) that has been published in the journal International Ophthalmology indicates that the most frequent symptoms are dry eyes, eye fatigue and difficulty focusing. The research has been carried out by professors from the UMU Optometry Department and a student from the Applied Optometry master's degree. Of the entire population that uses electronic devices to work, people with presbyopia have a greater tendency to suffer from the visual symptoms associated with this syndrome. Presbyopia is an age-related physiological condition that manifests itself after the age of 40 and causes blurred vision or difficulty focusing up close. In this work, the visual symptoms suffered by presbyopic people between 45 and 65 years old who use the computer as their main work tool were analyzed and it was determined that the computer visual syndrome is greater in women than in men, in the participants who use a computer. laptop versus those who use a desktop computer and in participants who telework versus those who go to the office. How we can reduce visual problems Sometimes it is almost impossible to reduce the time of exposure to screens because we work with them and because we tend to observe the world through our smartphone, but this dependence on electronic devices can cause computer vision syndrome. , which occurs when the eye overexerts itself when looking closely, reducing the reading distance and worsening the quality of the blinks. “The syndrome is more frequent and severe in participants who do not take breaks while working, who have worse lighting and who suffer musculoskeletal symptoms due to poor postural ergonomics such as cervical or back pain,” warns Caridad Galindo, professor of Optometry. from the UMU. The authors point out that the main treatment for computer vision syndrome is visual hygiene and preventive measures. “It is very important that, as opticians-optometrists, we educate and raise awareness among people about computer vision syndrome,” Galindo concludes. With these results, it is important to consider adapting work spaces with adequate equipment, adjusting the intensity of light, maintaining good posture and good ventilation or taking periodic breaks to look at distant objects and increasing blinking can help disconnect from work. screens and take care of eye health.",10,65

Four of these locations will be on the Espinardo de Murcia Campus (North Classroom, General Classroom, Giner de los Ríos and Labor Sciences); two in Cartagena (Industrial and Teleco); two in Lorca (CC Sociosanitarias and IES Ros Giner); and one in Caravaca (IES San Juan de la Cruz), Cieza (IES Diego Tortosa), Yecla (IES José Luis Castillo Puche) and San Javier (CC Deporte). The main novelty of this year's EBAU in the Region is that students with special educational needs who require an adapted exam will be able to take the tests at their reference location, without having to travel to a central location, as has happened until now. It is planned that there will be a classroom for adapted exams in each of the locations, with a psychologist as support. This change has involved a great organizational effort that will benefit about three hundred students; Only in a dozen cases will displacement be necessary due to the specific conditions of their adaptation. The EBAU coordination expects that this measure will favor the participation of students with special educational needs in the tests. Regarding the exam, the model will be the same as that implemented in 2020 as a result of the pandemic and which allows students to have more options for choosing questions. All information about the schedules, venues and calendar of the EBAU can be consulted on the University of Murcia website.",4,17

The annual income of the UMU through transfer contracts with companies breaks its record with more than 5.9 million,"The transfer of knowledge to society is one of the strategic pillars of the University of Murcia and the results of the Research Results Transfer Office (OTRI) reflect this. One of the indicators is that collaboration contracts with companies for the development of projects that provide concrete solutions to their innovation needs have grown significantly. In the last ten years, since 2013, the University of Murcia has almost doubled the income from what are known as 'article 83 contracts'. Specifically, the UMU has gone from earning 3,137,094 euros in 2013 for this concept to almost six million euros - 5,936,741 - in 2022. This significant increase in income is due to the increase in contracts with companies, which went from 327 in 2013 to 596 in 2022 in this same period; which represents an increase of 54%. Another indicator of good results in transfer is that in just four years, between 2018 and 2022, the University of Murcia has managed to multiply by 7 the number of projects obtained through calls from institutes and public administrations, as well as private initiatives. If in 2018 there were 7 projects of this type at the UMU, in 2022 there were 48 in force. This data also leaves a significant increase in the annual income that the University receives through this channel; which has gone from annual income in 2018 of 263,750 euros to more than 2.45 million euros in 2022. All these figures are the result of the effort made in recent years through the OTRI to give visibility to the third function of transfer with actions such as Knowledge Transfer Groups, the creation of the Transfer and Scientific Dissemination Commission, the call for financing activities to promote transfer, awards, etc. These good results are also framed in the context of the projects financed by the Next Generation funds, thanks to which the calls have been expanded. Also an example of the good results obtained in transfer are the 74 patents obtained since 2013 and the 17 technology-based companies born from the activity of the research groups of the University of Murcia in this same period.",16,123

The UMU and the UV join forces to analyze nutritional inequalities in Spain,"large team of multidisciplinary experts, including the group of José Miguel Martínez Carrión, professor of Economic History and Institutions at the University of Murcia (UMU), has published a book titled Inequality and nutritional transition in economic history. Spain in the 19th-21st centuries (Inequality and Nutritional Transition in Economic History. Spain in the 19th-21st Centuries). In it, as its title indicates, they analyze the different access to nutrition that Spain has suffered throughout its most recent history. Determinant factor of inequality Food consumption is one of the key characteristics that determine the living standards of a society and, in addition, access to good or bad nutrition establishes the biological factors of each generation. In Spain, in the last three centuries different socioeconomic variations have caused its citizens to see their access to food limited or, on the contrary, to have enjoyed abundant food. The results of eating more or less are reflected, for example, in the average height and body mass of different generations. The industrial revolution in the 19th century in which there was an exodus from the countryside to the city, the Civil War and its subsequent postwar in the 20th century and the current economic crises are some of the historical events that occurred in Spain that, one way or another In a way, they have determined society's access to food consumption and nutrition. But not only historical events give rise to nutritional inequalities, this book also analyzes nutritional inequalities associated with generational, gender or geographical reasons. Difficulties This publication has attempted to alleviate the problem of measuring past nutritional inequalities, since few sources are currently available. To do this, the authors have based themselves, on the one hand, on the study of primary sources on diets and, on the other, on the effects that dietary changes have had on body size. Thanks to this combination, greater study precision has been obtained of great interest to the different branches of historians and economists, but also endocrine doctors, pediatricians, anthropologists, nutritionists and experts in cooperation and development. Publication and authors Inequality and Nutritional Transition in Economic History. Spain in the 19th-21st Centuries has been published by the British publishing house Routledge, one of the most prestigious in the academic world.

Research from the UMU and the IMIB shows that exposure to environmental pollutants increases the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases,"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution is one of the greatest environmental threats to health. A study by the University of Murcia (UMU) and the Murcian Institute for Biosanitary Research (IMIB) demonstrates that continuous exposure to particulate matter - commonly known as PM10 or PM2.5 - increases the risk of developing atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia most common cardiac. In patients who already suffer from this heart disease, mortality and cases of stroke are multiplied. The increasingly high levels of this particulate matter formed by pollen, soot, smoke and dirt, among other substances, and the continuous growth in the prevalence of this cardiac pathology have led UMU researchers to publish their results in the journal Science of the Total Environment. Air quality is measured by these four pollutants: suspended particles; tropospheric ozone caused by industry and vehicles; the nitrogen dioxide emitted by means of transport; and the sulfur dioxide that is produced during the combustion of fuels. The study evaluates works published during the last 20 years where 17 investigations have already associated exposure to this pollutant with a greater risk of developing atrial fibrillation. A health and environmental problem Microparticles smaller than 10 micrometers in diameter are the ones that pose the greatest problem because they reach the depths of the lungs and some can reach the bloodstream. The authors found four studies that showed that increasing exposure to environmental pollutants increases adverse events in patients already suffering from atrial fibrillation. There is a greater risk of mortality and stroke due to mechanisms such as oxidative stress, deterioration of blood vessels and systemic inflammation, mechanisms that, in turn, also increase the probability of developing atherosclerosis and thrombosis. “To reduce air pollution in cities, in addition to ambitious policies, cardiovascular risk detection plans are needed for people who live in regions with low air quality. Given that the relationship between exposure to particulate matter and atrial fibrillation appears to be independent of the region of the world according to the results of the study we have carried out, environmental pollution should be considered a global risk factor and it is necessary to adopt specific measures to prevent exposure to air pollution,” concludes José Miguel Rivera Caravaca, professor at the Faculty of Nursing and researcher in the Clinical and Experimental Cardiology group at the UMU.",17,116

"Manual for the management of municipal social networks, a guide developed by UMU researchers to improve government communication","The transfer group of the UMU Political Communication Laboratory and the General Directorate of Local Administration of the CARM have developed the first study on digital government communication in the local public sector. Public administration is condemned to come to terms with the new digital media , adapting to its way of transmitting messages and bringing politics closer to a country that spends almost 2 hours a day immersed in the virtual world. The transfer group Political Communication Laboratory of the University of Murcia (UMU) publishes its Manual for the management of municipal social networks based on a study developed in collaboration with the General Directorate of Local Administration of the CARM. The main conclusions of the study indicate that the social networks of city councils fail to become a medium for interaction and are commonly used as a one-way “digital bulletin board”, but an Instagram reel generates more views and likes than any poster on the neighborhood bus stop. Followers value, above all, content, closeness and dissemination beyond a routine communication. The UMU researchers highlight that a horizontal and participatory dialogue must develop in government social networks and, at the same time, serve as an instrument for the provision of services and for reinforcing the credibility and legitimacy of governments. Receiving municipal information can awaken the interest and involvement of the municipality's residents in local politics thanks to its ability to reach young audiences, more distanced from traditional government communication. The bidirectionality and professionalization of the profile of network managers are two of the challenges for the profiles of mayors and local political parties that help project a good image beyond the municipal area of a town or city. A manual for the 45 city councils For several months, UMU researchers have analyzed and evaluated the activity of the 45 city councils and their mayors on Twitter and Facebook to prepare their Manual for the management of municipal social networks. The methodology used has incorporated Big Data techniques, the analysis of the content of hundreds of publications and interviews with network managers from all city councils. The results of this study and the Manual have been published by the prestigious publishing house Tirant lo Blanch, thanks to the collaboration of the Chair of Public Policies.",14,82

UMU researcher Alba Paniagua receives a Leonardo Scholarship to develop smart glasses to correct cataracts,"Alba María Paniagua Díaz, postdoctoral researcher at the Optics Laboratory of the University of Murcia, has been awarded one of the 7 Leonardo Scholarships awarded by the BBVA Foundation in the field of Physics. Paniagua has obtained this scholarship, endowed with 40,000 euros, to advance its project to develop smart glasses for the non-invasive correction of cataracts. About 70% of people over 65 years of age suffer from cataracts. Currently, the only solution is surgery, but in cases where this is not possible, cataracts end up leading to blindness. In fact, blindness from untreated cataracts accounts for 51% of blindness cases worldwide. A healthy crystalline lens is transparent, acts as a lens and allows you to focus. When a cataract forms, proteins within the lens aggregate together, causing light to scatter and cloud the lens as it passes through. Although surgery works very well, it is not always possible. For this reason, Alba María Paniagua's project seeks to develop smart glasses, similar to those used in augmented reality applications, for the non-invasive correction of cataracts. “With liquid crystal modulators, which modify the properties of light, we manipulate the light that reaches the lens in a way that compensates for the distortions caused by the lens particles,” explains the researcher. “What we do is change the incident direction of the light so that it reaches the retina correctly,” he points out. These glasses that the UMU researcher works on work in the same way as normal glasses for myopia or astigmatism. ""First you have to know how the eye acts: if it has three diopters of myopia, we put a lens in front of it that compensates for it,"" he adds. In addition, these cataract glasses, being electronic, would only have to be recalibrated as the cataract progresses, but not change them. So far, they have already carried out experimental proofs of concept where they have demonstrated light corrections in human lenses with cataracts. Although glasses will not be able to prevent the natural development of this ocular disorder, Paniagua's hypothesis is that they will serve to improve the vision of patients: “The objective would be that people who do not want to have surgery can live with these glasses, or that those where the cataract is very severe and the operation is recommended can have better vision until the moment of the operation, and possibly later."" The tests that will be carried out thanks to the Leonardo Scholarship will allow us to verify the full potential of this innovative technique against cataracts Alba María Paniagua Díaz (Huercal-Overa, Almería, 1990) is a postdoctoral researcher in the Optics Laboratory of the University of Murcia. He graduated in Physics from the University of Salamanca, and after completing his doctorate at the University of Exeter (United Kingdom) with a thesis on the fundamental correlations that are maintained when light comes into contact with dispersion media, he began a postdoctoral stage in the University of Murcia.

""If the increase in costs involved in the application of the LOSU in teaching issues is not resolved soon, we will really have a lot of problems in being able to do so."" With regard to the application of the changes that are being prepared on internships, Mayoral has pointed out that the Universities ""are concerned about having first and second year students, since in those studies in which there are no curricular internships the students will finish their career without having contributed and, in other cases, there may be students who reach five years of contributions.” The rector of Zaragoza, who has insisted that the CRUE demands a moratorium on this measure, explained that ""there are ministries that have already put it on the table for us to be the universities that assume this cost of the Social Security contribution."" and this worries us because it creates a trend.” Mayoral concluded his speech by assuring, however, that CRUE's spirit is to continue negotiating until the last moment. For his part, the Secretary of State for Universities, José Manuel Pingarrón, has expressed the good disposition of the Ministry of Universities for negotiation; although he has clarified that some of the issues that most concern universities are the responsibility of the Ministry of Labor and Social Economy, to which he has committed to transmitting the universities' concerns. For his part, the Minister of the Environment, Mar Menor, Universities and Research, Juan María Vázquez, wanted to highlight “the importance of this meeting, brought about by the numerous innovations offered by the university regulatory framework, which will give the opportunity to contrast the different points of view regarding the new legislation.” More information: https://www.noved.es/jornadas-crue-2023/",2,121

The UMU DICSO research group signs a contract with the Council of Europe to develop a toolkit to recognize fake news in history classrooms,"Activities will be designed to recognize, through history, the manipulation and hate speech that proliferate as a result of crises, pandemics or natural disasters, and the consequences that it can have for minority groups. According to the PISA report, Spanish students They trail behind the OECD average in detecting biased text and evaluating sources. Aware of the need to strengthen the digital skills of digital natives, the DICSO research group of the University of Murcia (UMU) has signed a contract with HISTOLAB, a joint project of the Council of Europe and the European Union, to develop a kit of tools on teaching multiperspectivity, and recognizing the manipulation of history. Researchers from different European countries and external reviewers from the United States and Canada also participate in the design and have based the kit on the scientific work method of historians. A method that can be reproduced in classrooms to make the Internet a safe place through the use of historical sources, contrasting testimonies, questioning who is interested in the information being disseminated, why, how and, above all, who it benefits. and who it harms. Through a training course, teachers will be able to implement a set of 20 activities in their own classrooms and data will be collected from more than one hundred secondary classrooms. More than a thousand students are expected to participate in the process. The consequences of the post-truth phenomenon This set of tools aims to develop skills in the treatment of historical information and in the recognition of fake news and hate speech in history, where the most harmed are: science, with denialist speeches about Covid-19 or climate delayers; history, where even the Nazi Holocaust is questioned; and minority groups, a target that causes, for example, that between 2013 and 2019 attacks related to hate crimes increased by 45% in Spain, driven by racism, extreme ideology and xenophobia. As Professor Cosme J. Gómez indicates: “Reliable information is key to the good health of democratic societies, in which citizens can access, evaluate and use truthful information to participate in public life.” This is a challenge to protect democratic rights that remain under continuous attack with political polarization, pseudojournalism and disinformation in the post-truth era. A phenomenon that occurs when speeches that appeal to emotionality have more influence in defining public opinion than objective facts.",17,146
Those responsible for the EBAU ask for a one-year moratorium on the new university entrance test,"Those responsible for the university entrance tests of the 17 autonomous communities, including the Region of Murcia, whose organization falls on the University of Murcia, consider it unfeasible to carry out the new EBAU for 2024 and demand a one-year moratorium from the ministry. When those responsible for the University Access and Admission Tests from all over the country gathered, they unanimously stated the following: That access tests are a fundamental element for the university future of thousands of students. Their hopes and expectations depend on their good preparation and execution, as well as those of their families and those of the teachers who train them. That the exam models and their correction criteria are unknown in sufficient time, as well as the detailed content of the ministerial order that will regulate these tests. Therefore, there is no material time for the centers to adequately organize a teaching program for the 2023/2024 academic year or for them to guarantee the prior training of the students. Likewise, universities will also not have the time necessary to organize the tests, which will prevent students from taking exams in conditions of equality and equity. In these circumstances, it is not feasible to assume the incorporation of the new exam models or the planned duration for each of them for the 2024 selective tests. We believe that the access to the university of students with adaptation needs is very seriously compromised. and that, in addition, the entire student body is subjected to a much higher level of stress due to the extension of the tests in times and dates.",7,139

Zelensky has called for the need for help and support from European countries in the face of the war and has invited students to visit Ukraine and strengthen ties with the country's universities when the conflict ends. Likewise, he thanked the universities present that since the beginning of the war have welcomed Ukrainian students and are helping them to continue their training. This meeting, whose organization had to be coordinated discreetly and without publicity for security reasons, was held within the framework of the European University for Well-Being, an alliance of universities that seek to improve the well-being of society and the environment in a sustainable way through joint teaching and research programs.

The UMU and the Robles Chillida Foundation will celebrate ten years of collaboration in financing aid for health research,"The University of Murcia (UMU) wants to highlight, with the celebration of a special event, the collaboration with the Robles Chillida Foundation on its tenth anniversary of granting aid to finance health research activities. This has been agreed by the monitoring commission to review the status of the projects and actions financed in the 2021 and 2022 calls, within the framework of the collaboration agreement between the Robles Chillida Foundation and the University of Murcia. Robles Chillida commission meetingThis committee, made up of members of the Robles Chillida Foundation board and the Vice-rector for Research together with other members of this Research Area of the UMU, has agreed to hold an event that will consist of the exhibition of posters, with which will remember the 40 projects financed to date, highlighting the impressive results obtained and how these have been transferred to society. Aid for pioneering research Since 2013, the Caravaca board of trustees has financed forty research projects aimed at the area of Health Sciences, with a total of 240,000 euros. Among the latest success stories, that of the Animal Medicine and Surgery researcher, Asta Tvarijonaviciute, awarded in the last call. Thanks to this help, important advances have been made in the creation of a saliva test, similar to those carried out for the detection of COVID-19, which allows knowing the physical condition, level of training and oral health and body condition of minors. with a minimally invasive technique. Also in 2022, one of the grants was awarded to Pedro F.

Luis Sánchez del Campo Ferrer, professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, was able to achieve, thanks to the financing of his project in the 2021 call, important innovations in research into a cure for melanoma cancer, the most lethal among types of cancer. skin, using pioneering molecular treatment techniques. Finally, Diego García Ayuso, professor of Ophthalmology and beneficiary in the 2021 call, has studied the advantages of using taurine to stop the progression of retinitis pigmentosa, a very common hereditary degeneration of photoreceptors with a worldwide prevalence of approximately 1 in every 4,000 people, and which is one of the main causes of visual disability and blindness in working age. These are just some of the most recent examples. The following call will be published soon, the beneficiaries of which will be able to present their proposal at the diploma ceremony for the 2023 edition.

The University of Murcia rejects the changes in the regulation of external internships prepared by the Ministry of Labor,"The University of Murcia rejects the draft of the 'Statute of people in non-work practical training in the field of the company' that the Ministry of Labor and Social Economy is preparing at the Social Dialogue Table, together with UGT, CCOO and CEOE and , which will presumably be approved at the meeting they plan to hold today, May 8. Although, through the Ministry of Labor, universities have been able to make some contributions, mainly to maintain the so-called extracurricular practices, the last known version of the draft (dated March 31) insists on an aspect on which the University of Murcia , as a member of the group of universities that make up the Conference of Rectors of Spanish Universities (CRUE), openly disagrees. This is the point that addresses the compensation of expenses to which students would be entitled during their internships and whose inclusion in the future statute could mean a drop in the offer of internships, as well as a serious management problem for universities. Firstly, smaller companies or companies with less economic capacity may be discouraged by the possibility of having to assume the additional costs derived from this compensation, which would limit training opportunities. This, in addition, can pose a problem, especially serious in degrees governed by European orders, which require a minimum of hours of mandatory internships to qualify and it could be the case that universities could not guarantee that students can graduate. On the other hand, the calculation of said expense compensation pool (transport, material, accommodation...) adds a very important management problem, since these expenses can vary depending on factors such as the type of internship and the sector in which are carried out and, in many cases, are very difficult to quantify. Universities do not currently have the personnel or management tools to guarantee equity in the estimation of these compensations for all students. It is also paradoxical that public administrations, which receive more than 60% of university students, are already posing obstacles to assuming this additional cost due to lack of resources. Social security contribution The compensation of expenses is added to another added problem, derived from the additional provision 52 of the General Social Security Law, added to this legal text last March and which requires contribution by the company of student interns. The University of Murcia, like the rest of Spanish universities, has always rejected this measure, which does not offer a substantial improvement in the protection of intern students and, on the other hand, is a deterrent for companies and public entities to accept students. In fact, many of those who want to continue doing so are already demanding that, contrary to the general rule of the aforementioned provision, universities assume the obligations of registration, cancellation and contribution. A comprehensive reconsideration of this measure would be the best option, without prejudice to examining other possibilities to truly improve the condition of student interns. In this sense, the University of Murcia reiterates its commitment to establish regulations and mechanisms that prevent students or those who graduate from universities from becoming cheap labor. However, the changes being worked on are detrimental to the students themselves and access to quality practical training during university education. For this reason, we insist, on the one hand, in rejecting the obligation to compensate for expenses provided for in the draft Statute and, on the other, we consider it absolutely essential to delay the entry into force of the aforementioned additional provision 52nd LGSS for at least one year.",2,107
"Diego García Ayuso, first UMU researcher to enter the Global Optometrist Top 200 Research ranking","The professor of the Department of Ophthalmology, Optometry, Otorhinolaryngology and Pathological Anatomy of the University of Murcia (UMU) Diego García Ayuso has just entered the list of the Global Optometrist Top 200 Research Ranking, a global research classification created with the aim of identifying and recognize the 200 optometrists with the greatest impact worldwide according to their publications in indexed scientific journals and the citations they receive. To date, this ranking had not included any professor from the institution but, recently, it has included García Ayuso in position 173, thus becoming the first professor to enter the classification, and one of the seven Spanish scientists to obtain this recognition. As a curiosity, this index is dominated by optometrists from the United States (71), the United Kingdom (45) and Australia (43), who represent 79.5% of the included researchers. Index h This listing recognizes the world leaders in optometry research from around the world. With this objective, a customized bibliographic search tool was developed to consult the Scopus scientific journal database and extract publication metrics, specifically the number of times scientific articles by these authors have been cited by other scientists. The current gold standard for analyzing the impact of an author's publications is to determine the ""h-index,"" suggested in 2005 by Jorge E. Hirsch, which combines measures of quantity and quality into a single metric. In this way the classification was conceived, ordering these researchers according to their h-index. Citation analysis is generally considered a useful objective tool for evaluating the impact of academic articles and, by extension, the excellence of those who write them. An important factor to consider when evaluating these metrics is the age of a scholar (likely correlated with the years they have been publishing), as a longer career offers more opportunities to accumulate more citations. In this regard, only 5 of the 200 researchers included in the ranking have a shorter publication period than García Ayuso. Career García Ayuso carries out his research work in the Experimental Ophthalmology research group at the UMU, led by Professor Manuel Vidal Sanz. In 2011 he obtained the title of doctor with European mention and his doctoral thesis was awarded twice at the national level. Most of his research career has been dedicated to the study of hereditary degenerations of photoreceptors such as Retinitis Pigmentosa; and acquired such as Age-Related Macular Degeneration, and the subsequent remodeling of the retina, as well as the search for strategies that allow stopping or slowing down the loss of photoreceptors. These diseases lead to blindness and are currently the leading cause of blindness in industrialized countries. Through their lines of research they aim to help understand the mechanisms of photoreceptor degeneration and the study of possible therapies or treatments.",13,77

88 percent of UMU staff are satisfied with their work,"The University of Murcia presented this afternoon, in the Rectorate building, the study of the Evaluation of psychosocial risks and the corresponding intervention measures to contribute to improving the well-being of its workers. José Luján, Rector of the University of Murcia, who directed the event, participated in the event; Paloma Sobrado, Vice Chancellor of Health Sciences and University Community Services; Mariano Meseguer, Health and Wellbeing Coordinator of the University of Murcia and Antonio Pérez Manzano, President of the Health and Safety Committee of the University of Murcia. The process began with the request of the CSS and the University Ombudsman, who urged the rector's team to undertake the evaluation of psychosocial risk factors in the institution. In this way, the “Report on the results of the psychosocial risk assessment” prepared by the ad hoc working group of the CSS and the Applied Psychosociology Services of the UMU (SEPA) has been made public. This report contains the methodology, results and intervention measures necessary to improve working conditions related to this type of risks. Psychosocial risk factors place emphasis on those working conditions that refer to the perception that the staff of an organization has related to their work content, their organization and their involvement in it. The study was carried out between the months of February 2020 and September 2022, and 1,540 people of the total 3,933 UMU staff participated. The CoPsoQ-istas21 method, a Spanish adaptation of the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire, was applied. This method identifies a total of 20 primary dimensions, grouped into six second-order factors. Since the completion of the report, the University of Murcia has been materializing and assuming the preventive measures that the report recommends. The Vice-Rector for Health Sciences and University Community Services, Paloma Sobrado, has thanked everyone involved in the study for the degree of involvement they have put into all the work. For his part, the President of the Health and Safety Committee of the University of Murcia, Antonio Pérez, stated that “the one presented today is one of the most important documents regarding the health of the staff in the history of the University. of Murcia"". He also said that it is “to feel proud of the fact of having an institution capable of taking a still photo as large, deep and intense as the one that has been done in this report,” and added that there are no reports comparable to this one in the public administration. . “You have to be brave,” he said, “to prepare a report of this depth and present all its results as we are doing today, and to do so with a battery of proposals to solve them.” He described the report as “technically irreproachable and brilliant.” He suggested that the report be repeated, since it offers a snapshot of the staff and should become a first study that offers from time to time the situation of the University of Murcia to see if we are on the right path, and finally asked that the actions proposed in the work are carried out. Mariano Meseguer, Health and Wellbeing Coordinator of the University of Murcia, highlighted the measures proposed by the report implemented in the last year: a historic agreement with social agents on labor flexibility and teleworking, a digital disconnection plan also negotiated with the social part, a prevention resource manual available to all UMU staff and a training plan that acts on factors for coping with stress and improving leadership skills. In addition, an analysis and evaluation of jobs and a plan for reception and improvement of the communication channels to be established are in the pilot phase. Likewise, in July 2022, the UMU approved a Health and Wellbeing Strategy that involves positive actions to improve the university community where the set of preventive measures contained in the report are assumed. Among the notable issues of this study, according to Meseguer, include the high degree of involvement and commitment of all UMU staff (77%), their overall satisfaction with their work (88%) and the assumption of a shit high level of work in terms of pace, intensity and job demands (55%), high decisional autonomy (61%), the need to improve the balance with family life (48%) and the network of closest relationships in the work (41%). The event was concluded by Rector José Luján, who highlighted that the fact that a university carries out studies on the health of its workers is not contemplated in the University rankings, but that “a university like Murcia, with its history and its tradition, it has to put people first, and it must carry out studies of this type, since only by doing this will we do our job well and it will be reflected later in the rankings. He thanked all the people who have made this report possible and recalled the first interview they did with him in the press when he expressed his willingness to run for the rectorate, in November 2017, in which he stated that “I want to do something so that the people of the UMU is happier,” and said that “this study provides invaluable information if we use it to continue moving forward.”",8,28

"Long naps associated with increased risk of obesity, metabolic syndrome and high blood pressure","The University of Murcia, through the team of researcher Marta Garaulet; and scientists at Brigham and Women's Hospital, linked to Harvard Medical School, have discovered through data analysis that people who take naps of 30 minutes or more have higher body mass indexes and are more likely to have metabolic syndrome; that is, to develop cardiovascular problems and diabetes, than those people who do not take this rest in the middle of the day. Over the last decades, different research has shown that napping can improve the quality of nighttime sleep, improve the individual's cognitive functions and improve metabolic processes. However, there are still many unknowns in the relationship between napping and metabolic health. This new study in which Professor Marta Garaulet participates has involved the analysis of health data from more than 3,000 adults in Mediterranean regions to examine the relationship between napping, its duration, the degree of obesity and metabolic syndrome. The result of this 'big-data' analysis makes clear a direct relationship between long naps and the risk of obesity, high blood pressure and metabolic syndrome. However, the data analysis also concludes that in those who take short naps (less than thirty minutes) this risk of obesity and metabolic alterations is not present. In fact, those who take short naps seem to have health benefits, since they are less prone to high blood pressure than those who do not nap. The results of this publication have just been published in the magazine 'Obesity'. “Not all naps are the same. The duration, napping on the couch or in bed, and other lifestyle factors associated with napping can affect the negative effect that napping has on our health,” says UMU researcher Marta Garaulet; who adds that “a previous study that was carried out analyzing data from a large population in the United Kingdom found evidence that napping is associated with an increased risk of obesity. In this case we wanted to determine if this conclusion could also be applicable in a country like Spain, where naps are more culturally established; as well as knowing if the duration of this rest is related to metabolic health.” Obesity is a growing health problem, affecting more than one billion people worldwide. Our lifestyle decisions, such as whether or not to nap, affect the metabolic mechanisms associated with obesity. In this research, data from 3,275 adults from Mediterranean areas, especially from the Region of Murcia, have been examined. Specifically, for the study, baseline data of different metabolic characteristics of volunteer participants in a study carried out at the University of Murcia were used; and, in addition, data from participant surveys regarding their lifestyle habits are also included. Specifically, they were asked if they took a nap, whether they took less than thirty minutes (short nap) or more than half an hour (long nap). The research team found a direct relationship between long naps and a higher body mass index and susceptibility to metabolic syndrome than non-nappers. Furthermore, compared to those who do not take a nap, they have a larger waist, and higher glucose, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure values. It has also been found that among the factors that influence whether a long nap makes you fat are going to bed late at night, eating late, eating a lot at midday or smoking. Surveys also suggest that one explanation for why long naps are associated with an increase in blood pressure is taking a nap in bed instead of on the couch. Although this is a so-called observational study and cannot demonstrate that napping is the direct cause of obesity; Another previous study by Marta Garaulet and collaborators with data collected in the United Kingdom Biobank pointed out that napping was a cause of obesity and not vice versa, particularly for abdominal obesity; which is the most harmful to health. The relevance of this study by Professor Garaulet and the rest of the team of researchers is that they have shown that there are a variety of life factors that influence whether napping makes you fat or increases metabolic risk. The results of the study open the door to future research into whether a short nap is more advantageous than a long one, especially for those individuals who have the habit of delaying meals and bedtime at night; eating a lot at midday or for those who smoke. “This study shows the importance of taking into account the duration of naps and raises the question of whether short naps may offer unique benefits.” Many institutions have realized the benefits of short naps, especially in terms of productivity at work, but also for general health. If future studies can support the benefits of short naps on decreasing the risk of hypertension and other metabolic diseases, I think that could be the impetus for knowing what our naps should be like, and how long they should be and what their long-term effects are. term for health and productivity at work and in life,” says Frank Scheer, co-author of the article and a neuroscientist in the Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders at Brigham's Hospital.

The UMU exhibits the work of Luis Izquierdo in the Rectorate Chapel room,"The University of Murcia has inaugurated this week the exhibition 'Homo deus. Lights and Shadows', by Luis Izquierdo García, in the La Capilla del Rectorado room. The installation proposed for La Capilla is composed of twelve similar sheets of paper that form two circles: a central one with four papers forming a cross, and another outer one with eight papers that occupy a radial space, around which the viewer can circulate. Conceptually, the work is about the idea of progress and nature. As the artist explains, “it seems that the old myth of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse - conquest, war, hunger and death - become the current causes of our inevitable destiny. Precisely, the scriptures speak of a scroll or scroll in the hand of God, sealed by seven seals.” This is the theme that is addressed in the four central papers. For Izquierdo, “the great actions of moderation in the use of limited resources, the saving of expensive energy, the recycling of millions of products already manufactured with planned obsolescence, seem to have nothing to do with large governments or gigantic companies. ""The same ones that corruptly justify and support the horror and desolation of unjust wars, the destruction of territories and lives to enrich themselves from it."" All good and bad human performances, with their lights and shadows, would correspond to the eight papers displayed in a circle that complete the installation. The exhibition can be visited until May 30 on Mondays and Wednesdays from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. and on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.",1,102
The European ClearFarm project presents the results of its research on animal welfare in pig and dairy farming,"Last Thursday, an information session and presentation of results of the ClearFarm project was held at the Teaching Farm of the University of Murcia. Clearfarm is a project funded by the European Union that has 13 representatives from 6 countries, including 5 universities and research centers, 5 small and medium-sized companies and 3 large companies, including El Pozo Alimentación and Cefusa. Its main objective is to more completely evaluate animal welfare to optimize production processes on pig and dairy farms. This innovative project takes full advantage of the new technological possibilities of precision livestock farming, to allow a detailed evaluation of animal welfare throughout the production chain. In this way, it contributes to promoting more sustainable production of pigs and dairy cattle, the two main livestock systems in Europe. To carry this out, a digital platform has been developed that collects exhaustive data on animal welfare, offering contrasted, clear and useful information for producers and consumers, aimed at facilitating their decision-making. The platform, presented during the activity, is in the validation phase and can offer information on animal welfare in a wide variety of production systems, considering the existing geographical divergences within European production systems. The Interlab-UMU research group, led by Professor Jose Cerón, provides experience in biomarkers of stress, inflammation, the immune system and oxidative status in saliva from the University of Murcia. Saliva is an ideal type of sample to evaluate the health and well-being of animals, since it can be obtained without causing pain or stress. Among the biomarkers analyzed, oxytocin, which is used to measure positive emotions, and cortisol stand out; chromogranin and alpha-amylase, which are markers of stress situations.",12,109

The University of Murcia participates in the constituent process of the United Nations 'Earth Assembly',"The University of Murcia has participated in the constituent process of the United Nations 'Earth Assembly' that took place at the United Nations in New York on April 24 and 25. Specifically, representing the UMU, the professor of the Faculty of Law and director of the Chair of Human Rights and Nature, Teresa Vicente; and the general secretary of the institution, Francisco González. Like every year, Mother Earth Day is celebrated on April 22. On this occasion, the UN Secretary General has urged “raise your voice and demand that leaders make peace with Nature.” It is a call to continue working to improve our harmony with Nature, accelerate climate action and implement the UN Biodiversity Agreement, with the aim of ensuring that 30% of our planet's land and water are protected by 2030 Over the past 15 years, the “Harmony with Nature” resolution has facilitated interactive dialogues focused on these concepts, drawing on both science and the traditional worldviews of indigenous peoples, among other knowledge systems. In this sense, the interactive dialogues “Harmony with Nature” have contributed to promoting multilateralism, a systemic vision of the economy integrated into the ecosphere and an increasingly clear awareness that it is imperative to conceive Nature and its elements as subjects bearers of rights, not as a mere scenario in which to develop our economic practices. These dialogues have allowed policymakers to learn more about methodologies and success stories based on community management of the commons (participatory ecosocial governance), ecological justice or meeting the needs of ecosystems and people in concepts such as good living or the well-being of living beings and ecosystems. The objective would be to go beyond the traditional anthropocentric vision of sustainable development and towards ecocentric conceptions. In accordance with General Assembly Resolution 77/169 of December 14, 2022, this year's Interactive Dialogue is mandated to discuss the scope and possibility of convening a high-level meeting, provisionally titled “Assembly of Earth”, which would be celebrated on 22 April 2024, so that the evolving non-anthropocentric or Earth-centered paradigm continues to reinforce multilateralism by discussing alternative holistic approaches, based on diverse worldviews that can contribute to achieving of the 2030 Agenda for “Sustainable Development and Beyond”. Thanks to the coordination of the United Nations Platform “Harmony with Nature”, this session of the Dialogue brings together a large representation of Spanish Universities: the University of Murcia, the University of Alicante, the University of Valencia, the Autonomous University of Madrid, the University of Malaga, the University of Castilla-La Mancha, the University of the Basque Country, the Rey Juan Carlos University and the Rovira i Virgili University. The teaching and research staff are part of different disciplines in which the intrinsic value of Nature is recognized: from Economics, Sociology, Philosophy to Law. The work of the University of Murcia has been fundamental for Spain to become the first country in the European Union to recognize the intrinsic value of Nature, through the attribution of the legal personality of the Mar Menor and its rights. being, without a doubt, a reference not only for other countries present at this United Nations meeting, but also an inspiring example for other forms of governance in spaces with problems associated with externalities / derived from abusive economic practices, related to many parts of Nature, as occurs in Doñana, La Albufera and Delta and the Ebro River basin, among others.",8,102
"The Hematology Service of the Virgen de la Arrixaca Hospital, directed by UMU professor José María Moraleda, celebrates more than 1,000 bone marrow transplants","The Hematology and Hemotherapy Service of the Virgen de la Arrixaca University Hospital in Murcia, directed by the professor of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Murcia José María Moraleda, celebrates this Friday the milestone of having surpassed the figure of 1,000 bone marrow transplants. Specifically, until December 2022, 1,115 transplants were completed. The commemoration took place in the Red Room of the hospital and was attended by the managing director of the Virgen de la Arrixaca Hospital, Francisco Soriano; the director of the IMIB, Pablo Ramírez; and the general director of Research and Pharmacy of the CARM, Jesús Cañavate; among others. During the event, in which Professor Moraleda spoke about the milestones achieved in bone marrow transplants and the challenges of the future, a talk was also given by Professor Jesús San Miguel, currently medical director of the University Clinic of Navarra and the Spanish scientist-doctor with the highest impact index. Among other merits, he is a National Research Award and a Waldenstrom Award; the most prestigious in multiple myeloma, a disease in which it is a world authority. The first bone marrow transplant performed at the Virgen de la Arrixaca University Hospital was performed in 1995 and was an autologous transplant, with stem cells from the patient himself. After the arrival of Professor Moraleda to the Hematology and Hemotherapy Service in 2007, two important milestones occurred: in the month of May, the first allogeneic transplant (with cells from a healthy donor) was carried out in a child in La Arrixaca; and a month later, the first allogeneic transplant in an adult took place. A year later, in 2008, the La Arrixaca medical team managed to complete a haploidentical transplant; that is, a bone marrow transplant from a donor compatible with the patient. That same year, the first transplant was also performed with stem cells from the umbilical cord. The milestones carried out by the Hematology Service in these years also include the accreditation of the cell production clean room, the opening of the Transplantation and Advanced Therapies Unit in October 2018 and the European Jacie accreditation, with the highest standards of quality, which was achieved in April 2020. Professor Moraleda explains that future challenges are focused on two objectives: reducing toxicity and complications that can arise from bone marrow transplant; and reduce relapses, since despite the effectiveness of these transplants, there are patients in whom the disease recurs after the transplant. Bone marrow transplant continues to be the only curative treatment for many malignant hematological diseases (leukemias, lymphomas, myelomas) or non-malignant diseases (marrow aplasia, congenital anemias), and can improve survival and quality of life in patients with some solid tumors. particularly children. However, it is a treatment that can have serious adverse effects, which is why it is usually indicated when the disease cannot be cured with other treatments. Among the curative properties of the transplant, in addition to the eradication of the disease due to the effect of high-dose chemoradiotherapy, and the reconstitution of hematopoiesis by the donor's progenitor cells, we must consider the beneficial effect of infusing the immune system healthy donor, which has great anti-tumor power (immune effect - against the tumor). In fact, allogeneic transplant from a healthy donor is considered, along with blood transfusion, as the first cell therapy, and one of the best acquired immunotherapies. Multidisciplinary work All these milestones in bone marrow transplants are the result of multidisciplinary work in which almost all the medical services of the Virgen de la Arrixaca University Hospital are involved. Along with the Adult Hematology and Hemotherapy Service, the Children's Onco-Hematology Service also works; as well as all the medical specialties necessary for the preparation and care of the patient, before and after the transplant. The Virgen de la Arrixaca University Hospital is one of the national reference hospitals for pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplants and also one of the few in Spain where hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is performed with complex cellular selection. The hospital has recently been named by the Ministry as one of the 20 Spanish centers authorized to perform immunotherapy with CAR-T cells in adults and is the fourth hospital in Spain to perform this type of immunotherapy in children.",3,95
"José Miguel Noguera Celdrán, re-elected as director of the scientific journal Archivo Español de Arqueología","The publications commission of the Higher Council for Scientific Research (CSIC) has appointed the professor of Archeology at the University of Murcia (UMU), José Miguel Noguera Celdrán, for a second term as director of the scientific journal Archivo Español de Arqueología. The appointment has been made at the proposal of the new Editorial Board of the magazine.

Since its inception it has become a magazine of great national prestige. , also being one of the most recognized at European level. It has traditionally been chosen by Spanish and Portuguese archaeologists to make their research known to the rest of the scientific community. José Miguel Noguera Celdrán The professor, with a degree in Geography and History, has previous management positions on his resume, having been general director of Culture of the Region of Murcia between 2003 and 2008 and a full member of the prestigious German Archaeological Institute. During its first mandate between 2019 and 2022, the Spanish Archive of Archeology magazine has experienced important changes, including the move to a purely digital edition. Noguera Celdrán has also been director of some of the most important archaeological projects in the Region of Murcia during the last decades, such as the Molinete Archaeological Park of Cartagena and this year he joins the management of the Roman Amphitheater project of Cartagena. He complements this with the leadership of numerous national and international projects focused especially on Roman archeology and the authorship of more than 30 books and 275 publications in scientific journals. He is currently coordinator of the Archeology area of the History and Archeology panel of the State Research Agency. A look towards the future After serving his first term as director between 2019 and 2022, and after this last re-election, “my intention is, once my position is over, to retire. This type of work is very rewarding, but it requires a lot of time, has a lot of workload and, sometimes, too much stress; so eight years will be fine,” says the professor. Under his direction, the expert seeks to continue advancing in the digitization of the project and finish implementing OJS (Open Journal Systems) editorial management, making new research open access. Furthermore, it aims to expand the chronological profile of the scientific journal, renewing the idea of archeology towards a more current perspective. The director seeks to extend his field of study not only to the Medieval but also to the modern and contemporary world.",6,123
Could you explain your doctoral thesis in 20 tweets? The UMU joins the III edition of the #HiloTesis contest,"Scientific dissemination in the time of Twitter has allowed researchers to make their work known to society through 280-character tweets. These micro-stories allow synthesis, simplification, visibility and adaptation to a language far removed from papers to talk, for example, about the mysterious shipwreck of a cruise ship “Queen Regent” in 1895 or the prognoses and survival of leukemia in the Region of Murcia.

The artist Danny Cruz exhibits an exhibition about his migratory experience at the UMU,"The University of Murcia has inaugurated this week the exhibition 'Migratory Experience', by the plastic artist Danny Cruz, in the ES/UM space on the La Merced Campus. The main objective of the exhibition is to address the migratory experience from an artistic perspective, generating an aesthetic experience that speaks about the memory, longing and distance that marked the artist's early age. The project is presented as a work in which the author goes to his mother and, together with her, travels through a past, a few years where his life took place in simultaneous times, but in the distance. It is about reconstructing childhood through parallel times, sharing the reality of a mother and a child in migration. In short, the artist generates a self-portrait in an expanded sense, which shows his ability to portray himself through his migratory experience, his experiences, his time and physical existence, but also his image.

Rector José Luján receives the Rex Vivo Cine Platform and shows his solidarity in their fight to achieve the continuity of this historic theater,"The rector José Luján received this Friday, in the Convalescence building, headquarters of the Rectorate, a delegation from the Cine Rex Vivo Platform, listening to their demands and supporting them in their fight to maintain this historic cinema, the oldest of those in the city, as a projection room. The members of the Platform have let you know how this old room, even before the University of Murcia itself, was always closely related to the UMU, since the three film clubs of Murcia held screenings there, always sponsored by university students: Cine Club Murcia in 1936; the SEU Cinema Club in the 50s and early 60s and the Luchino Visconti University Cinema Club in the 80s and 90s. In addition, it hosted the meetings of another Platform, the Pro Culture Platform which, in 1932, defended the UMU from its disappearance, in suppression by the dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera. The members of the Platform have raised the need for regional and/or municipal authorities to take charge of this historic and emblematic building, and to continue using it as a movie theater and other cultural uses, something that, according to them, It would enormously enrich the city of Murcia in an area that does not have a specific economic value, but that represents a much higher and intangible internal value, that of the sentimental education that properties have that, like this one, has been a meeting point and inflection for almost all the citizens of this city who, for five generations, have enjoyed this screen as that open window to life that cinema has been since its inception, telling viewers other people's stories that have made them vibrate as if they were the their own. The rector has been in favor of the survival of this theater as the cinema that it has always been, and has supported their demands so that this cinema, as old as the University of Murcia, and with as much strength and vigor, continues its work as cinema hall, and has called on the UMU Cinema Classroom to collaborate with the Cine Rex Vivo Platform.",11,96
Elena Rodríguez Egea exhibits a work on the concept of motherhood at the UMU Rectorate,"The University of Murcia has inaugurated this week the exhibition 'Destruction of the mother/Reconstruction of the mother' by Elena Rodríguez Egea, in the Black Box space of the Rectorate. 'Destruction of the mother/ Reconstruction of the mother' aims to offer a visual narrative from an autobiographical point of view about the concept of motherhood. As the artist explains, “questions such as whether being a mother is a given or a construction are raised in this work that highlights fragmentation as an element of healing and whose discourse underlies the lack of a mother-child relationship. This lack, conceived as a trauma, is subjected to materialization through sculptural practice, thus establishing a new physical order outside of an emotional disorder. The title determined for the piece alludes to the key reference in this work, Louise Bourgeois, and briefly anticipates the two phases into which its development is divided. “It describes both the personal and formal process of the work, where the concept obtained from the mother has to be destroyed to be rebuilt. At the same time, in the creation process, the figure of a pregnant woman is built, which must first be dismembered (destruction) to be cooked and later assembled (reconstruction). All this concludes in a piece that represents a future vision of the protagonist as a mother.” The exhibition, organized in collaboration with ODSesiones UMU, can be visited until May 26.",8,65

UMU professor David Prieto García-Seco discovers a hidden reprint of the first academic dictionary in one volume,"David Prieto, professor of Spanish Language at the University of Murcia (UMU), recovers an unknown episode in the history of the Dictionary in one volume, a project that the members of the Academy completed at the end of the 18th century to create a manageable and economical work. for the people that, today and 241 years later, reaches its 23rd edition, which can be consulted online. Copy of the dictionary Following the slogan of a well-known second-hand application “If you don't use it, upload it”, an individual decided to sell for 1,200 euros a copy of what he considered the first printing of the 1780 Academy Dictionary: the same cover, the same number of pages, the same date of edition and publication in the famous printing press of Joaquín Ibarra from Zaragoza. Everything looked exactly the same, except the content. The UMU professor bought the copy without initially knowing its value. Some time later, when for one of his investigations he was comparing this second-hand edition and the compilation of dictionaries published online by the RAE (New Lexicographic Treasure of the Spanish Language, NTLLE), David Prieto realized that the edition that was he knew until now and the one he had in his hands did not match. In your copy of Wallapop the word cabrerya appeared with a vowel y, while in the digital version you could read cabrería, with a Latin i. This minimal change in a letter marked the beginning of the discovery of the reprint that had remained hidden for more than two centuries, a missing link between the dictionary of 1780 and its second edition, of 1783. This work did not even appear in specialized bibliographic catalogs. about the 18th century, neither in the records of libraries around the world, nor in Spanish and foreign archives. The researcher, who could not believe the discovery, commented in surprise to academic Pedro Álvarez de Miranda: “How is it possible that this work has remained hidden for so long!” As the study progressed, Professor Prieto confessed: “In our research we very rarely experience the joy of stepping into terra incognita; With this work I had the exciting sensation of entering the unknown.” Improvements that passed to the second edition, of 1783. The reprint of 1781 (although dated 1780 on the cover) incorporates a title page, centers the little tilde of the letter Ñ on the cover, which in the first printing appeared displaced to the left, and modifies various diacritical marks: the circumflex accent of chîa is deleted, which becomes chia; Pasqüa's umlaut is eliminated; and different accents such as ridiculous are added, but they are also deleted: Judéa changes to Judea. Numerous commas are modified, letters are replaced - for example, complaining becomes complaining - or they are added when they had been omitted by mistake, the h is added horizontally. Among other changes, some entries were also reordered alphabetically and the meanings of several articles were even internally restructured. But all these corrections only reach the first third of the Dictionary (320 pages out of 954); the rest remains intact, as in the first impression. This research opens new avenues of work and raises some unknowns. 70% of the changes were transferred to the 1783 edition, but why were the remaining 30% not preserved in this second edition? For example, in the discovered work absorb was amended to absorb; However, in the 1783 copies it would return with v, contrary to its etymology. “The verb with the anti-etymological v,” explains UMU professor David Prieto, “remained intact in the editions of 1791, 1803, 1817 and 1822, until, finally, in 1832, the graphic solution proposed by the rescued reprint was adopted. , which is what survives to this day: absorb.” A work to tell the story of another work This detective investigation, begun in January 2021, is narrated in detail in the new book by David Prieto: A recovered link from Spanish lexicography (Visor Lingüística), with a prologue by the academic Pedro Álvarez de Miranda and dedicated to the lexicographer Manuel Seco. Once the hidden reprint was discovered, the UMU professor has verified the existence of other copies of the hitherto unknown dictionary in the New York Public Library, in the Municipal Library of Lyon, in the Student Residence of Madrid or in the Library Headquarters of the University of Navarra.",8,65

CIBER researcher at the UMU publishes a book to achieve “Let nothing keep you awake”,"Let nothing keep you awake' is the commitment of María Ángeles Bonmatí, researcher (CIBER, Carlos III Health Institute) of Chronobiology at the University of Murcia (UMU), to bring scientific knowledge about this physiological process to society. In it, Bonmatí addresses different aspects of sleep in an informative way, explaining, for example, what happens in our brain and body while we sleep, with the aim of banishing myths rooted in the common imagination, such as that which says that the more we sleep, the less you live “The objective is to begin to value sleep as a fundamental physiological process for life and which must be cared for and protected, not only at the individual level but also at the institutional level,” says the author, who has a doctorate in Physiology. . The dilemma of sleep, or the lack of it, has been present throughout the known history of humanity, therefore, Bonmatí dedicates part of his publication to exploring the appearances of sleep in its different artistic manifestations, starting from mythology and covering painting, music, literature and cinema. It also includes a chapter on the sleep characteristics of different species of animals, since some, thanks to evolution, have managed to manage this process to remain alert to the dangers of nature during rest hours. In addition, it dedicates a chapter to how to sleep in space, thanks to a collaboration with astronaut Pedro Duque. “This chapter was included taking advantage of my participation in an international and multidisciplinary project coordinated by the European Space Agency, in which we evaluated the effects of a microgravity simulation on circadian rhythms and sleep,” explains María Ángeles Bonmatí. The importance of sleep Sleeping is an activity carried out by all living beings, therefore, a book dedicated to it could not simply be dedicated to those who have a sleep disorder, although, as the author explains, “it also applies to them.” directed and I hope it helps you understand your problem in a constructive way. It would be great if the guidelines or recommendations provided can benefit them.” That is why the book “Let nothing keep you awake”, in addition to offering the aforementioned guidelines for good sleep, includes different scientific perspectives to publicize this process and improve the habits of the population, since it may happen that Due to ignorance, we spend less time than necessary sleeping without having any underlying pathology. Sleep problems in today's society A complication resulting from the current pace of life is the lack of time to dedicate to rest. As Bonmatí comments, there are many causes that “steal” time from sleep or deprive it in today's society. One of them would be the high level of stress to which we are subjected, which contributes to the appearance of mental health diseases, such as anxiety. ”In fact, one of the biggest risk factors for insomnia is rumination: repeatedly turning over a worry that literally keeps us awake,” explains María Ángeles Bonmatí. Another cause is the shifting of certain activities to night time, such as late dinners, which should be done at least two hours before going to sleep, or carrying out sports activities, such as training, at the end of the day, when the schedule allows it, which favor activation, avoiding the state of relaxation necessary to rest. It also affects the consultation of mobile devices from bed, whose light sends us incorrect information about the time of day and, in addition, the consultation of content produces cognitive activation that makes it difficult to fall asleep. Little exposure to light during the day and excessive light at night are factors that can contribute to a worse circadian rhythm, a problem in which Bonmatí is an expert, since her doctoral thesis was based on the effects of light on the circadian system, for which he received the Extraordinary Doctorate Award. And, of course, let's not forget the noise to which many people are exposed, making it difficult for them to sleep and harming their quality of life.",16,123

The UMU relies on art to stop the cognitive deterioration of older people,"The University of Murcia coordinates the research of the From Bubble project where the stimulation produced by contemporary art will be evaluated in 120 people with cognitive impairment. The brain from Art is an artistic intervention developed at the Poncemar Foundation and the University of Murcia (UMU) in which it studies how people with cognitive impairment interact and work with contemporary works based on the concept of the From Bubble project, a proposal by the Spanish artist Daniel Bagnon who creates the idea of bubble, as the minimal unit of a brain that is losing the ability to connect its neural network is capable of analyzing and processing. This research, coordinated by Professor Catalina Guerrero Romera, from the Department of Theory and History of Education at the UMU, seeks to explore the relationship between art and the brain to demonstrate the benefits of creation and artistic experience in healthy aging. and in the emotional, social and cognitive well-being of people. The study was carried out in collaboration with the Occupational Therapy degree professor Laura Delgado Lobete and included a significant number of university volunteers. Art as a tool to improve the quality of life 120 participants who came from various day centers in Lorca made a plastic creation based on the concept of Bubble, based on four-color acrylic paint. The result of this artistic intervention will be evaluated through a scale that aims to know the benefits of working with art in older people in four central dimensions of quality of life: Health-physical well-being, Emotional well-being, Social participation and Personal development, because it has been shown that working through art allows you to exercise the mind, producing a cerebral, cognitive and emotional imprint. “We must highlight the research component of this project supported by the University of Murcia. There are many studies that show the benefits of artistic creation and experience to promote more active and healthy aging,” says the coordinator of the study, Catalina Guerrero, who has made clear the fact that these actions have a strong component of research and innovation that tries to respond to the challenges of aging and thus advance new models and methodologies that help in treatments and intervention. The study participants come from the Poncemar Foundation Day Centers, the residences in the city of Lorca, the San Diego Residence, the Caser-Alameda Residence, the Domingo Sastre Residence of the IMAS, and the Lorca Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Associations.",3,26
Rector Luján inaugurates the cycle of online seminars aimed at publicizing the benefits of implementing the European Logo for Human Resources in Research,"The rector of the University of Murcia (UMU), José Luján Alcaraz, inaugurated last Wednesday, March 15, a cycle of online seminars aimed at UMU staff, both Teaching and Research Staff (PDI) and Administration and Services Staff ( PAS). In this first seminar, the benefits of implementing the European Logo for Human Resources for Researchers (HRS4R) at the University of Murcia were addressed. The objective was to publicize the HRS4R UMU Action Plan, the actions that have already been implemented, those that are in progress and those that are expected to be implemented between now and June 2025. In his speech, the rector mentioned, for one part, that “obtaining this recognition accredits the way in which the University of Murcia treats the people who research there and that it must be a way comparable to the way in which the best institutions dedicated to research in the EU do it” and, on the other hand, he highlighted that “UMU is part of the EU where better research is carried out and that it offers a stimulating, attractive work environment where each person can develop their research interests and, finally, that it is an important seal that It gives us international visibility.” In subsequent meetings, the actions that have been carried out at the UMU will be detailed, showing attendees the procedures and how to participate and benefit from the measures implemented. Likewise, it is planned to have invited experts who present good practices and experiences from other organizations, with the aim of improving the implementation and knowledge of the project among UMU staff. María Senena Corbalán García, vice-rector for Research, reviewed the current state of implementation of the strategy, reinforcing the message that at the end of this implementation “all researchers and the entire university community have assimilated and imbibed the seal as another piece of knowledge, and as a way of working at an institutional level.” He also highlighted that the UMU has all its actions very advanced. For her part, Lorena Muñoz, CEO of Effectia, an expert in strategic innovation consulting, recalled that the relationship of all researchers with this seal has to do with participation in work groups, initiatives and surveys, but also with “the use of of all the resources that are being launched through the Logo, such as the deployment of policies around good practices in research, training courses, access to professional career advice, etc.” Finally, he highlighted that obtaining the Seal changes the culture and ways of doing things in institutions through a battery of resources that researchers must know and use. During 2023, two more seminars will be held, in June and November, in which it is planned to address “Good Research Practices within the framework of the HRS4R Seal” and “Open Science and Open Data in Research.” . In 2024 and 2025, another 3 seminars will be held on gender issues in research, new evaluation criteria and the application of OTM-R (Open, Transparent and Merit Based Recruitment) criteria in the selection and hiring of research personnel, as an element central in the implementation of the HRS4R Logo at the university. The University of Murcia (UMU) obtained the quality seal granted by the European Commission 'HR Excellence in Research' on June 2, 2020, to support universities and research institutions in hiring researchers to contribute to the development of a attractive European labor market for researchers. Since 2018 and especially since the granting of the HRS4R seal, the UMU has implemented a large part of the actions defined in the Action Plan. Now, the UMU is in the final phase of implementation, its next milestone is reaccreditation at the end of 2025. This cycle of seminars is framed in the dissemination actions of the HRS4R Seal Action Plan at the University of Murcia (Action 16 of the Action Plan).",17,26

The UMU patents a device that improves the quality of life of patients with Hemianopia,"Researchers from the University of Murcia and the Schepens Eye Research Institute of Massachusetts – MEI (USA) have designed a new device that uses high-power prisms to optimally expand the visual field of patients with hemianopia, a condition in which the field of vision is reduced by half. The new device, which attaches to the lenses used by these people, offers an answer to some of the limitations of the correction prisms typically used to treat this condition. heminopsia There are different types of hemianopsia. One of them, called the same name, is what we are trying to respond to using the patented device. Specifically, it consists of the loss of the right half or the left half of the visual field in both eyes simultaneously, reducing it from approximately 180 to only 90 degrees, and is mainly caused by strokes, brain tumors and head trauma. People with hemianopia have difficulty detecting dangers in their peripheral vision, which causes collisions, falls and other accidents, also making it difficult to carry out their daily activities such as difficulty reading, driving problems, loss of mobility,... leading to to a decrease in independence and the inability to enjoy leisure activities. One of the ways to treat hemianopia is to expand the visual field by using prisms mounted or embedded in the glasses worn by people affected by this condition. Ophthalmic lenses are optical elements whose function is to disperse and deflect light and the way in which they do this depends on the characteristics of the user and the magnitude of the necessary correction. In the words of Fernando Vargas, UMU researcher and co-inventor of this device, “the application of prisms in people who suffer from conditions related to loss of visual field is to expand the effective field of vision of a patient to regions that said person cannot. can see, or put more simply, they manage to transfer the peripheral image that these people do not perceive to the central area of their field of vision. To date, solutions based on prisms manage to achieve a maximum of 30 degrees of enlargement of the visual field, although it has been found that to prevent these people from suffering accidents and collisions, an enlargement of said field of at least 45º is required. Furthermore, these models usually present problems associated with the poor quality of the transferred image. The device developed and patented by the UMU and the MEI expands the visual field of patients with hemianopsia by up to 50 degrees, optically moving objects from the blind side of the visual field to the side that is not affected, while reducing dispersion chromatic aura produced by the prisms, so that the sharpness of the image is much greater. This is achieved thanks to an innovative construction form protected by the patent, consisting of a cascade composition of several prisms, placed in a very specific way in terms of their overlap and angle with respect to each other. Another important advantage is that production costs are substantially reduced, since the optical system would be assembled using mass-produced commercial prisms, which drastically reduces its price compared to the need to have to work with specific prisms according to the characteristics of each patient. . The new development represents a significant technical advance, which improves the quality of life of patients who suffer from visual field loss, and companies specialized in the commercialization of solutions for this type of people are currently being sought, who are interested in the license and exploitation of the patent, in order to achieve a correct transfer of the technology.",10,102

"The proposal for teaching history through transversal themes designed by UMU teachers, an example of good practices in Europe","Teach history, not as a succession of dates, names, places and battles; but from transversal themes that allow Secondary Education and Baccalaureate students to understand the great events and changes experienced throughout history. This is the great objective of the European project 'HistoryLab for European Civic Engagement', directed by the professor of the Faculty of Education of the University of Murcia Cosme J. Gómez. The innovative nature of this project, which will allow teachers of these educational stages to have materials and resources to design their syllabi and activities, has led Gómez, and also UMU professor Juan Ramón Moreno, to present their proposals at the European Innovation Days in History Education, a meeting of professionals in the teaching of History organized by HISTOLAB, a joint initiative of the European Union and the Council of Europe. At that meeting, specialists from all over Europe presented their successful experiences and good practices to improve the teaching of this essential subject in the curricula of all countries. ""What we propose is, for example, that through a transversal theme such as 'Travel and travelers', content is developed that includes population movements since prehistory, trade routes and their cultural importance, discoveries, colonizations or migrations. It is about studying great historical events with another approach and taking into account questions of thought and historical consciousness,” explains Professor Cosme J. Gómez. In the project, ten transversal themes in the history of Europe have been raised, more than 3,000 digital resources have been collected on its website and 30 teaching and learning proposals based on these themes. 'Rural world and urban world', 'Under a cloak of terror', 'Persecuted by Justice', 'Churches and religions' or 'Everyday life and social inequality' are some of the themes they propose. The researchers who have participated in the project believe that this way of teaching history is the best way to get young people to learn and reflect on knowledge of the past. “The ultimate goal is to provide an alternative vision of the European past that encourages civic commitment with democratic values in students,” says the UMU professor. “HistoryLab for European Civic Engagement” is an Erasmus + project coordinated by Professor Gómez. In addition to the University of Murcia, the University of Porto, University of Bologna, University of Amsterdam, University of Malmö, and University of Helsinki also participate. A guide book with proposals for teachers Along with the dissemination of the results of the initiative in forums such as the European Innovation Days in History Education and the distribution of the materials through the historylab.es website; The conclusions of the work carried out by the participating researchers have been published in the book 'Re-imagining the Teaching of European History. Promoting Civic Education and Historical Consciousness', from the prestigious Routledge publishing house. This work, with contributions from researchers from 12 universities in 7 different countries (Italy, Portugal, Holland, Sweden, Canada, USA and Spain), includes both theoretical chapters and case studies. The first part of the book addresses topics such as teaching the history of democracy in a globalized and interconnected world, multicultural and critical approaches, teaching uncomfortable narratives of the past, and approaches based on historical thinking and the use of digital resources. The second part of the book presents thematic chapters dedicated to the teaching of transversal themes in the European curriculum such as: violence and armed conflict, family and social inequality, gender equality, technological revolution, travel and travelers, power and powers, or rural world and urban world; the topics worked on in the research project coordinated by the UMU. The ultimate objective of this book is to promote critical teaching of history, civic engagement, and the drive for methodological change in history education. It is aimed at researchers and students of history education, civic education and social sciences, and history teacher educators.",4,35

With the experience that accredits him throughout his career as a forensic doctor, Lorente ruled that there are always consequences for women after experiencing an episode of sexual violence, both on the physical and emotional levels. Lorente reviewed some of the most high-profile cases and made clear his concern about the progressive increase in group rapes in a segment of the young population that, according to him, is not due to an increase in complaints, but to a change. of behavior influenced by porn.

However, he also pointed out his concern about those issues that have led to a reduction in the range of sentences for aggressors, which has caused social alarm. Lorente made clear his opinion that, while it may be interesting to start a debate about the effectiveness or not of harsher penalties for any crime, crimes of sexual violence should not have been the first to be experimented with. Lorente has an extensive resume as a researcher in the field of forensic medicine and as part of that research activity he participates in two research groups on gender violence. She has combined this work with positions in the public sector in the field of gender violence. He has been general director of Legal Assistance to Victims of Violence and Government Delegate for Gender Violence.

UMU Computational Physics students celebrate the Day of the number ? 'Pi',"The activity carried out by the students of the UMU Computational Physics class consists of a group photograph, where they show the first figures that make up the iconic number 'Pi' (3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169...). This is an initiative launched in 2019 by the professor of Applied Physics at the University of Murcia (UMU), Rafael García Molina, to encourage students to celebrate this mathematical constant. The activity consists of the students themselves designing one of the first figures of this number, freely, putting all their creativity on paper and then the group of students is photographed displaying each one the figure they have decorated, placed orderly according to with the number pi. Why is ? 'pi' Day celebrated? Pi Day has its origins in 1988, following an initiative by Physics professor Larry Shaw at the University of San Francisco in California. On March 14, referring to the Anglo-Saxon date system, the month is represented first followed by the day so the 3rd month and the 14th day (3/14). This date has gained so much popularity in this country that in 2009 the United States House of Representatives officially declared this day as National 'Pi' Day. Since then, many countries celebrate Pi Day, doing different activities with students, such as various experiments to calculate some of the infinite figures of this number, mathematical problems where it is necessary to use the number, draw the number 'pi' and even they disguise themselves as the digits of this mathematical constant. The important thing is to celebrate it in the most entertaining way possible, to increase the number of people in whom an interest in mathematics is awakened. “As the numbers of 'pi' are infinite, the ways to celebrate this day are also infinite,” in the words of the professor of Applied Physics at the UMU. What the number Pi consists of The number 'pi' is an irrational number, which results from dividing the perimeter of a circle by its diameter. It is a mathematical constant that represents the relationship between the length of a circle and its diameter. Widely used in the disciplines of mathematics, physics and engineering, despite being composed of a series of infinite decimals, only a few figures are needed to perform daily calculations. It is one of the most important numbers in history, being key to the development of the great civilizations of the world. Used in Mesopotamia, Ancient Rome, Egypt and China, as well as making small appearances in the Bible. Mathematicians around the world have dedicated efforts to determine the value of 'pi' as accurately as possible, as of today 50,000,000,000,000 digits are known. The mystery of March 14 for science In 2019, UNESCO approved in Paris, at the request of the International Mathematical Union, March 14 as the International Day of Mathematics in recognition of the importance of the discipline. But this day hides some curious facts, on March 14, 1879, one of the greatest physicists in history, Albert Einstein, was born, and in 2018 another great name in science, Stephen Hawking, died. Furthermore, March 14, 2020 was when the state of alarm was declared for the management of the COVID-19 global health crisis.",10,32

"The Brazilian dentist Jaime Cury, Honoris Causa doctor from the UMU","The Brazilian Jaime Aparecido Cury has become this Thursday the first Dentist Doctor Honoris Causa from the University of Murcia in the almost 40 years that Dentistry studies have existed at the University of Murcia, first as a School of Stomatology and since 1992 as Dentistry. The solemn ceremony took place in the Auditorium of the La Merced Campus. Jaime Aparecido Cury's work and research has always focused on the field of Cariology. With several books to his credit, 350 research articles and 33 book chapters, as well as 42 master's theses and 44 supervised doctoral theses, he can undoubtedly be qualified as a teacher of researchers and teacher of dentistry professors at an international level, having received some of the most important awards in their specialty in their field of work. Without his research, Preventive Dentistry and modern Cariology would not be understood, as has been made clear in the speeches of his godfather and the rector, José Luján. His most important lines of research are the anti-caries effect and the safety of methods of using fluoride in the development of enamel/dentin cavities, the effect of sugars, etc. He has also been a health advisor in Brazil, Chile, Peru and Madagascar, intervening in the development of health legislation for the community prevention of dental caries through the fluoridation of drinking water. Their studies changed the minimum doses of fluoride contained in toothpastes. During half a century of his career as a researcher and as a teacher, he has been a professor and director of researchers who today occupy relevant positions in many of the main dental schools in the world.

The UMU starts the only research in Spain on Huppke-Brendel syndrome to help Gabriela,"The Immunity, Inflammation and Cancer UMU-IMIB research group has committed to knowing what is behind this rare disease that approximately 10 people suffer from around the world, including Gabriela, a girl from Algeciras who seeks help from the Murcian team. research led by the professor of Cellular Biology and Histology at the UMU, Victoriano Mulero. A letter to the Three Wise Men that circulated on the Internet was the call for help from parents who were not asking for toys for their daughter. The only gift they ask for is an investigation to save the life of their one year and five month old little girl. The circular movement of their large blue eyes, muscle weakness or eating problems were the first symptoms of this incurable genetic disease that has made them travel thousands of kilometers searching for a scientific answer to a pathology with a life expectancy of just five years. . A German research group had recently discovered the disease working with zebrafish, a study model that is being worked on at the Faculty of Biology because it preserves approximately 85% of the genes that cause human diseases. It is very easy to manipulate using CRISPR-Cas9, a technology developed by Francisco Mojica at the University of Alicante, which allows you to “cut and paste” pieces of genetic material to alter the SLC33A1 gene, which causes Huppke-Brendel syndrome, in larvae. of these small fish with blue and gold stripes. How to fight a neurodegenerative disease that you hardly know about “If one day any other child has this disease and their doctor tells the parents that their child has Huppke-Brendel and they Google it, they won't get two articles like they turned out for us,” Ramón, Gabriela's father, tells Onda Algeciras. The syndrome causes muscle atrophy until it reaches the cerebellum and causes death. These parents from Algeciras have managed to give visibility to this pathology and find hope in the UMU-IMIB research group, which will analyze how up to 800 drugs affect the study model. “As the target of all these drugs is known, we will be able to understand how they are acting and delve deeper into the mechanism responsible for the disease,” details the IMIB researcher. Although they have discovered that patients suffering from Huppke-Brendel have very low levels of copper in their blood, they move forward without knowing what effects the different medications will have and if any will be able to cure Gabriela, mitigate the symptoms or stop her progression completely and manage to save his life. Meanwhile, her parents continue to seek more help to improve their little girl's life expectancy through the Princess Gabriela Association and have created a social media account to spread the word and seek collaboration called @princesagabrielita.

María Trinidad Herrero assured in her speech after collecting the award that, despite the fact that there have been great social advances in equality, it is still a reality that it is more difficult for women to be researchers and that it is necessary to continue working with conviction for equality and for meritocracy. For her part, Francisca Ferrando, dean of the Faculty of Law, has collected the distinction and expressed gratitude for a recognition that rewards the teaching, research and institutional initiatives carried out by the Faculty in favor of equality; among them, the existence of a specific vice-deanship. Isabel María Saura was in charge of collecting the recognition for the transfer group 'PaCiencia la Nuestra' and in her speech she highlighted that only 35% of those who make up the group are women, which demonstrates the importance they have both in the context university and society in general the support of men for the cause of equality. The rector, José Luján, wanted to congratulate the award-winners and expressed his wish that the 8M be just another day, “because on March 9, the 10th and every day we have to continue working for real equality and effective.” The event ended with the reading of the manifesto, which maintains that “only from a university education free of bias can we effectively empower women in all areas of political, work and social life. From universities we fight to defend equal rights and opportunities, and combat gender roles and stereotypes, gaps and discrimination that, even today, also persist in the university environment.”",5,83

This initiative, launched by the UCC+i and the Equality Unit of the UMU, joins other pioneers in this field such as the UCC+i of the University of Valencia (UV). Women like Teresa de Jesús or the novelist María de Zayas were already writing during the Golden Age about the role of women in our country: “If they gave us books and tutors, we would be as suitable for positions and professorships as men and perhaps sharper,” Zayas defended. Today, gender studies in universities question the work culture, the patriarchal structure and the prejudices that still exist in public higher education institutions. This initiative aims precisely to promote the inclusion of the gender perspective as a transversal category in science, technology and innovation to fight against such prejudices.

The Conference of Deans of Fine Arts meets in Murcia to confront the new law on artistic education,"The University of Murcia will host the meeting of the Conference of Deans of the Faculties of Fine Arts in Spain on March 2 and 3. At this meeting, decisions are expected to be made on the unitary response to the draft Law on artistic education, on which the Conference has already expressed its resounding rejection due to the equation it makes of these teachings with university studies. The opening of the conference will take place this Thursday, March 2, at 10:00 a.m. in the Assembly Hall of the Faculty of Fine Arts, on the Espinardo Campus. The rector, José Luján, will attend the event together with the dean of Fine Arts of the UMU, Victoria Sánchez Giner; Alfonso Ruiz Rallo, president of the Conference and dean of the University of La Laguna; and Sonia Madrid, vice-rector of Studies at the UMU. The attendance of the general director of Cultural Industries and the Arts, Manuel Cebrián, is also planned. On February 22, the Conference already showed in a harsh statement its deep concern regarding the draft law that equates artistic education with university education and made it clear that university faculties ""will not tolerate the crossing of red lines that represent a harsh attack on the quality system.” In fact, the Conference of Deans has threatened to take this legislative modification to court. “We agree that it is necessary to find a space that regulates higher artistic education, which has been demanding solutions for years, but we are not going to allow cracks to occur against the university system,” they stated in the letter. The conference strongly maintains that “university education can only be offered in universities” and that “professional competencies should not be confused with academic ones.” In addition, they emphasize essential differences between artistic teachings and Fine Arts studies from the development of study plans, quality control processes by ANECA and regional agencies; as well as the training of university teachers.",11,30

UMU-Company Project develops a novel wastewater purification system based on fungi,"The University of Murcia (UMU) has participated in the recently completed BIOFUNGUS project, which has allowed the design and optimization of a biological wastewater purification process through the application of oleaginous fungi, as an alternative to traditional processes based on aerobic bacteria that They are usually applied in water treatment plants. The final objective of this proposal was to obtain treated effluents that met the regulatory requirements to be used as irrigation water and/or for discharge into public channels. 1 The project has been led by the Murcia Municipal Water and Sanitation Company (EMUASA), and has also had the participation of the Energy and Environment Technology Center (CETENMA). Professors Victoriano Garre Mula and Sergio López García, from the Fungal Genomics and Molecular Biotechnology Research Group, participated on behalf of the UMU. These researchers have been responsible for carrying out the obtaining and selection in the laboratory of fungal strains, specifically from the Mucor lusitanicus family, that showed a better assimilation performance of the different nutrients and contaminants in the water, subsequently validating their effectiveness. in a pilot plant built at the EMUASA facilities. It has also been the object of the UMU's work to optimize the conditions of mushroom cultivation to maximize its production, prolong the half-life of the crops and optimize the dosed quantities to ensure wastewater purification yields. The developed pilot plant consists of a bioreactor, a type of tank, where the fungi are grown and through which the residual water is passed, which remains in contact with the fungus for the retention time necessary to eliminate the nutrients present. in the water, these are made up of both organic and inorganic matter and among which ammonium stands out as one of the main contaminants to be eliminated. The clarified water then passes to another bioreactor, called anaerobic, and a second strain of the fungus is dosed, this one specialized in the elimination of nitrates that could not be eliminated in the previous phase, the system reaching 100% elimination of them. the few hours after inoculation. In these stages, sludge is generated, a solid waste that must be managed by the treatment plants. However, the treatment with fungi, compared to other common biological treatments, has managed to generate less sludge, and, therefore, a lower cost associated with its management. . Furthermore, the sludge obtained is rich in fungal biomass with a high concentration of fatty acids, which increases the possibilities of being recovered and used, for example, to generate biogas through anaerobic digestion. Another advantage of using the Mucor fungus is its resistance to so-called emerging contaminants, such as drugs, pesticides, herbicides and hormones, which are found in representative concentrations in wastewater and which are usually very complicated to eliminate using traditional biological procedures. , which also decrease their efficiency in the presence of contaminants such as antibiotics. However, the use of fungi has shown its ability to reduce these emerging contaminants by a large proportion, in some cases by percentages close to 100%. In short, during the course of the Biofungus project it has been proven that the Mucor lusitanius fungus has the capacity to consume organic matter from wastewater with removal yields greater than 90% and ammonium and nitrate removal yields of 100%. Its satisfactory growth in wastewater from different sources and the ability to valorize the solid waste generated have been demonstrated. The BIOFUNGUS project – Implementation of a two-phase wastewater purification process using filamentous fungi - has been financed by the Center for Technological and Industrial Development, dependent on the Ministry of Science and Innovation.",6,50

The UMU leads an innovative European project to evaluate Islamophobic hate speech on social networks,"The University of Murcia (UMU) leads the European project Evaluating Campaigns against Hate (ECO), co-financed by the Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values Program (CERV) of the University to tackle Islamophobia in both in the real world and on social networks in Spain. The UMU, together with the University of Salamanca and the organizations Al Fanar Foundation for Arab Knowledge and Creating Traces, will organize three awareness actions throughout 2023 in the cities of Ceuta, Madrid and Murcia to spread positive messages among Spanish youth that help the inclusion of the Muslim community through art, gastronomy and history. The main researcher of ECO is the professor of the Arab and Islamic Studies Area of the UMU, Pilar Garrido. Doctor in Arabic Philology from the University of Salamanca, she has numerous articles on Islamic mysticism, historiography, Islamophobia, Arab women and comparative literature. His interests also include a notable production on innovative didactics, comics, stereotypes, intercultural and interdenominational dialogue. Her career as a disseminator of Arab-Islamic culture has earned her several awards and recognitions. Pilar Garrido belongs to several R&D&i research groups on Al Andalus, inclusive heritage, Andalusian thought and Sufi mysticism and is part of European projects on teaching innovation and Islamophobia. She has been general coordinator of the Mare Nostrum Campus of International Excellence of the Universities of Murcia and Cartagena. Along with Garrido, the professors from the Faculty of Documentation and Communication Rocío Zamora and María del Mar Grandío also participate in this European project on behalf of the UMU. While on behalf of the University of Salamanca, the professor of the Department of Sociology and Communication Carlos Arcilla and his research team will collaborate in the academic part. Arcilla is a member of the Audiovisual Content Observatory, which was founded in 2005 to study and analyze the contents, uses, processes and effects of communication in media such as the written press, television, radio, cinema, new information technologies. and new interactive media. In coordination with the UMU, the USAL team will carry out research that will create the first Spanish map of conceptual frameworks on Islamophobia in networks, which in turn will be disseminated in articles published in JCR academic journals. Transfer and social intervention In addition to these two Spanish universities, ECO partners are the Al Fanar Foundation for Arab Knowledge and the Madrid NGO Creando Huellas. Al Fanar has more than 20 years of experience in Spain and with offices in Madrid and Murcia, its objective is to bring the political, social and cultural reality of the Arab world closer to the Spanish-speaking world. Chaired by Pedro Rojo, Al Fanar is an independent foundation that raises awareness and values the linguistic plurality, ethnic variety and cultural diversity of the Arab world. While the NGO Creating Huellas develops its social intervention prioritizing work with groups that are in situations of vulnerability and social exclusion. So these four partners will identify an innovative knowledge transfer strategy that will help build a culture of communication from social cohesion based on the understanding and dissection of hatred towards Muslim people or towards Islam through concrete, empirical actions. , analytical and interdisciplinary. Three awareness campaigns in 2023 ECO is structured around three awareness actions that will be carried out throughout 2023 in Ceuta, Madrid and Murcia. These are three environments selected to work on prejudices against Muslim people from three spaces. In Ceuta we will work using video art and photography as tools within the framework of the multicultural reality of the city: Christian, Muslim, Jewish and Hindu communities. In the autonomous city, the Coexistence Prize Foundation will collaborate as a local organization. The next campaign will be carried out in Madrid with the event 'Creating: making the world a better plate', where Islamophobia will be combated through gastronomy with a double approach to Arab food, but also from other Muslim countries. For its part, the streets of Murcia will be the scene of the third ECO campaign through a 'street escape' game through the historic center to foster relationships of belonging and knowledge of our Andalusian roots around characters like the wise man. Ibn Arabi or the Wolf King. Final guide This entire process will have as its final product a methodology so that organizations that carry out awareness campaigns against hate speech can evaluate whether their actions have really had the intended impact. The guide will have a double version: the full version in Spanish and the European version (in English) with the basic points that can be common to all environments, plus a section explaining the steps used in ECO to be able to adjust to each reality. The methodology. Creating young 'influencers of good' For the UMU professor and researcher, Pilar Garrido, “it is about promoting greater knowledge of Arab and Islamic culture from art, gastronomy or history to eliminate those stereotypes and labels that by ""Unfortunately, they lead to dangerous behavior both in the online world and in our daily lives."" ""We will evaluate and analyze thousands of tweets, posts or videos with Islamophobic content, and then work on how to tackle them and redirect these attitudes always in a playful way, mixing training and awareness and, finally, carrying out recreational actions hand in hand with art, gastronomy or leisure. The project is focused on the young population, that is why we will speak their own language,” he specified. ""In the long run, the underlying objective will be to generate 'influencers of good', so that young Spaniards share positive messages that promote interculturality and put a stop to hate speech,"" he summarized.

Javier Rivas affirms at the UMU that it is necessary to properly regulate cryptocurrencies,"Javier Rivas Compains, CEO of IFRYDHE and Professor at the Universidad Pontificia Comillas ICAI-ICADE, gave the conference 'The Crypto Crash: Causes and consequences' last Thursday at the Faculty of Economics and Business of the University of eMurcia; a talk that focused on contextualizing everything related to cryptocurrencies and the current scenario of the value of cryptocurrencies in the markets, focusing specifically on the 'Crypto Crash', a phenomenon that is defined as the sudden loss of value of the main cryptocurrencies in general and bitcoin in particular. Initially, some notions were shared about what cryptocurrencies are, as well as about Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology, which allow the storage of all information securely through cryptography. Rivas also highlighted the different uses of blockchain as a means of payment and the potential benefits of this type of technology in payments. In his conference, Professor Rivas made an analysis of the current market, showing the best-known cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum and Tether) and their value in the market. We observe that cryptocurrencies have lost between 66% and 75% of their value, depending on the crypto asset. In the case of bitcoin, it falls below its previous highs and it is the first time in its history that it falls so sharply. The speaker explained how at the end of 2021 the bitcoin market entered into crisis, clarifying the various causes of this latest collapse of the cryptocurrency, in addition to its possible consequences. Javier Rivas Compains emphasized the importance of regulation in this area, since being unregulated digital assets, they do not have the status of legal tender nor are they backed by central banks. Likewise, they do not fully fulfill the functions of money as a medium of exchange, unit of account and store of value. This creates a huge credibility problem. On the other hand, the speaker commented on how we find ourselves facing a market in constant evolution and technological change. In this sense, he indicated that current cryptocurrencies can be replaced by the digital assets of the CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency), legal tender digital currencies issued by the central banks of the different monetary systems. These centralized legal tender currencies (regulated by a bank) were born as an alternative to cryptocurrencies and pose a great danger to them. Javier Rivas Compains is Director and founding partner of IFRYDHE, has a PhD in UNIZAR Economics, Master Collège d'Europe Professor ICADE and UC3M, and one of the main national experts in the field of financial markets and crypto assets.",13,85

UMU participates in research that discovers how a rare disease could have protected Jews against tuberculosis,"In a recent study published in the journal PNAS, scientists from Cambridge, Netherlands, Pennsylvania (USA) and researcher and professor at the University of Murcia (UMU), Francisco José Roca Soler from Spain, have discovered that genetic variants that increase the risk of developing Gaucher disease also help protect against tuberculosis. This rare disease affects one in every 50,000 births on average in the general population, while there is one case in every 800 births in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. For centuries, Jews have been persecuted for the faith they profess, for Nazi supremacism and for racism, especially for their tendency to consanguinity, especially during the Middle Ages. This could be one of the reasons why Gaucher disease is overrepresented in this population group: almost all the children came from the same family, this is called the “founder effect.” But it may also be that there was positive selection by some agent in the environment. That is to say, during the Middle Ages they were marginalized, they lived overcrowded in ghettos and were malnourished while tuberculosis spread rapidly throughout a Europe of poor neighborhoods and exclusion, acting as a “bottleneck”, selecting the population most resistant to this devastating infectious disease. . Thus, Jews who possessed the Gaucher mutation might have survived tuberculosis better. These alleles or mutations were fixed in a positive selective manner and did not disappear despite being deleterious (bad for the carrier) because before developing any symptoms they had already reproduced, their children had the mutation and were more resistant than the rest. This rare disease has different degrees, with alleles that produce Gaucher with a strong neurological factor with early death during childhood to alleles that cause a very mild disease that goes undiagnosed in up to two thirds of cases because symptoms are not too severe and all They generate resistance to tuberculosis. Zebrafish as a study model The bacteria responsible for tuberculosis, called Mycobacterium tuberculosis, manipulate and use macrophages to cause the disease. The macrophage is a type of immune cell that 'eats' toxic material, including bacteria, but ""the pathogen that causes tuberculosis has learned to live inside and what it wants is to recruit more macrophages to reproduce better and have more houses,"" explains the professor at the UMU Francisco José Roca. This study used the zebrafish model because there is a bacteria that naturally infects it and is genetically the closest to those that cause human tuberculosis. The team had already found that the model with mutations that affect protein digestion and lead to lysosomal diseases (the lysosome is the part of the cell in which all this degradation of everything that is eaten occurs), became more susceptible to tuberculosis. This pathology involves deficiencies in some enzymes that prevent the destruction of proteins, the macrophage eats, cannot digest it, becomes full and is unable to move. All of this creates susceptibility because the macrophage cannot carry out its function in the tissues, whether they are everyday tasks such as eliminating cells that die naturally, or specific defense tasks such as reacting quickly to an infection. “After that study we wanted to continue investigating other lysosomal diseases. “In Gaucher’s case, the material that cannot be destroyed is a lipid.” “The hypothesis was that these animals were going to be susceptible to tuberculosis, but the opposite happened, the zebrafish with Gaucher were resistant. So that's where the project began” “We said: perhaps during the altered fat metabolism these individuals produce “something” that is toxic to the bacteria and helps kill it. And that was the case, that rare lipid that is formed, called glucosyl-sphingosine, acts like a detergent.” What happens is that the macrophage 'eats' the bacteria, introduces it into the lysosome and, while the bacteria is resistant to many things that the macrophage does to try to kill it, it is highly susceptible to this lipid that acts as a detergent : binds to the membrane, destroys it and the bacteria dies. This discovery opens three avenues: the possibility of using this treatment to combat other infectious diseases, shorten the time for a person infected with tuberculosis to be cured and also prevent the appearance of resistance in the bacteria that causes tuberculosis, a problem with that we face today: “There are cases of tuberculosis that cannot be treated and the only possible intervention is to remove the affected areas as if it were cancer.” It is possible for a normal person without Gaucher disease to produce this lipid for a short time, because if it is prolonged it would cause the disease. “To treat tuberculosis, a combination of several antibiotics is required for a minimum of six months. These medications are not free of toxicity, some damage the liver and others cause depression and suicidal tendencies. This treatment would be of great help to enhance the effectiveness of the treatment,” concludes Dr. Roca Soler, proud to be able to continue researching tuberculosis from his laboratory in the area of Immunology, infectious pathology, clinical microbiology and tropical medicine group at the UMU. -IMIB (Murcian Research Institute Pascual Parrilla) and collaborating with scientists from different parts of the world.
